It's like rihanna put herself into this so we can have her pic perfect skin.. no flash back.. dries down but does not oxidize..Not sure about longevity yet, but will definitely try it in the gym as it is meant to be sweat proof.

I have pretty oily skin which makes wearing regular foundations hard for me, because at the end of the day it leaves me with lines, creases, and a shiny forehead and nose. I'm not one to always have blotting paper or powder on hand to touch my makeup up, so I decided to try this matte foundation in hopes of it being of some help. This foundation did wonders for my skin! I love it so much that I have bought three of them so far, and see myself buying more in the future. It has a velvety smooth finish that dries and leaves your skin looking photoshop flawless. It's almost like you have a filter on your face! It's also buildable, and has amazing coverage and staying power. I wore it to prom and danced and sweated in it, and still looked amazing at the end of the night! Not an oily patch or crease in sight! Absolutely LOVE this foundation. It also has a very nice light smell on top of everything. I'm very pleased with this product. Definitely worth the money!\n",

Second, shake foundation bottle very well for long lasting effect. I've worn it for the past two weeks and have received many compliments on how natural my makeup looks. This foundation is superior to others I've tried for combination oily skin like mine because it dries up matte and powdery which for one allows me to totally skip on translucent powder and keeps oiliness at bay for at least 8 hours. I've even worn it on sweltering humid weather in which I tend to blot my face more than usual to dry my sweaty face and the foundation stays intact. I wear two layers for medium to full coverage which is enough to cover my blemishes and even out my skin tone but still look like I'm not wearing makeup.

When it came back in stock I went to pick it up at a Sephora near me the next morning. I have oily/combination skin, more towards the oily side and this foundation lasts me a good 7-8 hours before I need to blot or touch up. This is my new go to foundation! To me, it's a very natural, light to medium coverage which is exactly what I like. And I feel it (somewhat) blurs my pores to a nice air brushed finish. It's a comfortable matte too, not too dry. I would highly recommend for people who love a natural touch for everyday use.\n",

This foundation is superior to others I've tried for combination oily skin like mine because it dries up matte and powdery which for one allows me to totally skip on translucent powder and keeps oiliness at bay for at least 8 hours. I've even worn it on sweltering humid weather in which I tend to blot my face more than usual to dry my sweaty face and the foundation stays intact.

If you have dry skin this will not work well for you. Although it has a very nice finish once it is applied, it feels sort of dry and will cling to dry patches. I hear the argument that you have to moisturize a lot, and use primer to make this foundation work. Well, I always moisturize and use primers, and still this foundation felt dry. For reference I am 49 and have combination skin. This foundation accentuated my wrinkles (made them look dry) and gave me a couple of zits on my forehead (some foundations do that to me).

I tried with and without sunscreen and it didn't alter the fact that the longevity was poor and it didn't hold up. It just looked bad and I have combination but good skin.

      "I'm the shade 420. At first I LOVED this product. Like I was ready to give up my holy grail foundation for this! The positives: I love the finish on this and the match is really really good. It looks like your skin but better. Unfortunately, I returned after about 2 weeks because I don't think it's as long wearing as I would like it. I also touch my face throughout the day and this transfers too much even after setting it with powders. Also, I don't always like to set my entire face because I don't like looking cakey. You should definitely try this and see if it works for you!\n",

      "I did love this and truly think it's an amazing foundation, but for my dry skin, it's a no go. It accentuates my dry patches, which my estee lauder double wear does not. If I can ever get my skin on track, I might try this again. Also, wasn't a fan of smell, but I would have tolerated it, should I have kept foundation.\n",

      "I wanted to love it because everyone else did but it didn't go well for my dry skin it was very difficult trying to blend it and once it was on, it was too white and Flaky on my skin\n",

      "I LOVE this make up. I know everyone has reservations about using it if they have dry skin, but I have very dry skin and I use a really good moisturizer and primer and NYX setting spray and I’m good to go!\n",

      "I love the scent this foundation has , but that's the only good thing about it. I love the Fenty highlighters and lipsticks and I wanted to love this foundation , but it looked so bad. I have dry skin , so I exfoliated, and moisturized and it still made my skin look extremely dry and cling to dry spots, I also think it was not good coverage. Hope Fenty comes out with a liquid foundation for dry skin. I did not purchase the primer with it because it was too expensive (for Me) but I also think you shouldn't have to use the brands primer for the foundation to work !\n",
