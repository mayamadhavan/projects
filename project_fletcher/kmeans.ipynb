      "I purchased the Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation a few weeks ago. I have extremely pale skin, and finding a foundation that I love and also matches my skin color is almost impossible. I had heard lots of good things surrounding Fenty Beauty's large shade range for months, so, finally, I purchased the foundation. It matches my skin very well; I don't have to lighten it with a white foundation (I have to with other foundations I use) but the formula did not impress me. Dislikes: I knew it dried down quickly from the YouTube reviews I watched before purchasing, but I had no idea just how quick. I dotted the foundation onto one portion of my face, and used a damp beauty sponge (Miracle Complexion Sponge from RealTechniques) to blend the product in. On certain areas of my face, you could see a faint circle of where I dotted the foundation, even after blending well. The biggest thing I didn't like was how it clung to the dry skin on my face. I have combination skin: oily T-zone, dry areas around my mouth and cheeks. I don't have actual dry spots at this time of year, but the skin in that area is definitely drier than my T-zone. I loved the way the foundation looked on my forehead (oily skin), but my cheeks and mouth (dry skin) left much to be desired. Even though I didn't have any spots of dryness at the time, the foundation seemed to emphasize what wasn't there before. Likes: The consistency is not thick, but not very liquid-like either, it's a good in-between. If you have oily skin, I think you'll love this product. It tones down the oiliness, but still lets your skin have a nice, natural look to it. It makes your skin soft, a sort of velvet-matte feel. The foundation smells powdery to me, but it isn't overpowering or unpleasant. It stays on the skin for a long time, and does not smudge away easily. My oily T-zone still looked nice after 8 hours of wear. I won't purchase this product again. But if it works for you, then rock it like Rihanna!\n",

      "I REALLY wanted to like this product. I had seen some good reviews and when I color matched it in a store, it was PERFECT. However, the spot where I matched it on my face was the one spot on my forehead that is the smoothest, oiliest, and is also scar free. When I got home it had oxidized in the one spot, and became a bit to yellow, but that didn't bother me (I am very fair skinned and have patches that are more pinky and some that are definitely more yellow, so sometimes one undertone works better than the other). It was also a little warm in my car so I did sweat a bit on my forehead, so it seemed fairly moist looking at that time. When I got home, as I wanted to try how it wore thought the day, I cleaned, primed, and started to put the foundation on. It was a nightmare (probably felt worse because I really wanted to like this product). It dries too quickly, and becomes hard to blend after a few seconds (damp sponge, brush, and finger, all the same). As I tried to fix that, I noticed it accentuated all of my acne and chicken pox scars (I have some big pox scars on my cheek that don't cover easily). I finished the whole face, and I looked like a piece of white chalk that was next to a piece of yellow chalk, my skin looked and felt DRY. It was very hard to look at my face and feel good about it. I had a friend (going through cosmetology courses) come over, who also thought it looked bad, and she tried some things to see if she could get it to work, and if it didn't accentuate my pores, I looked to dry. Nothing worked, and I after it oxidized, it was to yellow or dark and no longer matched. My friend tried it, and it did work well for her, as she has normal/oily skin, but my color was too light (after oxidizing). For me, it was to dry for my skin, and the oxidizing was strange (maybe a miss batch bottle?). But my friend did get some and she loves it. But for really dry, and scarred skin, it was a sad miss.

No setting is necessary; as it dries quickly. I applied with the Sephora #47 foundation brush and thought that it went on perfectly. Beware of the dry down...I was lucky in that I swatched three shades in store and was able to match from there, but they do seem to darken a bit from what the color looks like in the bottle. Pretty happy with the wear time too. Applied at 7am and was still looking good at 5:30 pm. Overall, super happy with the product and will continue to throw my money at this company\n",

I am not the full coverage type I love when my skin shines through and you cannot tell if I have anything on my face. My skin is normal with slightly oily T zone so the formula doesn't move around on me and it definitely is long lasting.

Even with the primer and more moisturizer, I couldn’t get this foundation to work on my dry skin. The positives of this product was that it almost completely hides redness, photographs really well, and feels lightweight on my skin. I plan to return it since I have tried it 4 times with the same results. Maybe Rihanna will release a hydrating formula for dry skin in the future - I would love to try that.\n",

Until I found this! It is soooo comfortable, literally feels like nothing. I only use 1 pump for my entire face and a bit extra under eyes, the coverage and finish is beautiful, looks so natural just like skin and has a matte finish. It also holds up for a good 12 hours, and since I have combination dry skin I don't even need to use setting powder on my cheeks now. The only thing to be careful is it does dry down a bit darker than when you first pump it out, so watch out when you choose your shade!

I figured this was one of those overly hyped celebrity products but I figured I'd give it a chance and I'm glad I did. I don't really have textured skin so I don't have issues with pores or dry patches which some people say they deal with. I like the finish, it's not dry or oily and it has good coverage. It looks like skin, not like cake...with that being said, it looks HORRIBLE if you try to layer it so work quickly once you place it down and build up the spots that need it really fast. There is a lot of talk about oxidation and it doesn't oxidize on me, it dries down so it starts off a little lighter than it ends up drying down to but it doesn't change throughout the day. I would recommend this product.\n",

It is going to be extremely difficult to pick a color from online swatches. I really like this foundation. I'm amazed at how matte it is and remains throughout the day. I am oily and after 4 hours of wear, I still don't need to blot. It's the first foundation that makes me think I can get away without setting it with powder (I do, of course!). The very thin formula makes it very lightweight and capable of building up to fuller coverage and still look like skin. It will cling to dry patches so you may want to avoid if you have dry skin, or be sure to moisturize and prime with hydrating primer before application. And finally, I can't not mention the fact that Rihanna released 40 shades! Incredible and unheard of. Brava, Rihanna! I've worn this foundation for two days straight since purchasing it and both days I received compliments from people who have seen me many times previously. I will definitely be adding to my stable of foundations.\n",

Usually I have more yellow undertones when it comes to foundation, and in this description it says it has a peachy undertone but I don't think it's too peachy, only the slightest in my opinion. With one application total my face was medium coverage, and I builded it up for full coverage. I did not experience any creasing at all but I typically avoid putting a lot of foundation in my smile lines anyway. It is very lightweight and does not feel cakey at ALL! Since this foundation does dry fairly quickly, what I do is I pump a bit on my finger to place it on my skin and then use a beauty blender to blend it out. From what I've experienced with foundations in general this really helps when you have to move quickly. I used this in my normal face routine as well because I really wanted to see how it would hold up, primer, color corrector, foundation, powder, and it looked beautiful. The bottle itself feels very nice and heavy like more expensive foundations feel like, looks very chic, and I honestly have no complaints that I could give, I highly recommend that you at least get a sample of this or try it out in store- well worth it!!! :)\n",

Second, shake foundation bottle very well for long lasting effect. I've worn it for the past two weeks and have received many compliments on how natural my makeup looks. This foundation is superior to others I've tried for combination oily skin like mine because it dries up matte and powdery which for one allows me to totally skip on translucent powder and keeps oiliness at bay for at least 8 hours. I've even worn it on sweltering humid weather in which I tend to blot my face more than usual to dry my sweaty face and the foundation stays intact. I wear two layers for medium to full coverage which is enough to cover my blemishes and even out my skin tone but still look like I'm not wearing makeup.

I used the fenty primer and the milk makeup blur stick one the parts of my face with bigger pores. I use a brush to put the foundation on and blend it in and then I take a damp beauty blender and use it to blend it more. It goes on super smooth and gives my face a nice air brushed finish. I set it with the kat von d setting powder and it stays in place all day long. My face still gets a bit shiny but the foundation doesn’t move at all. I only use 2-3 pumps of it so the bottle lasts a long time. I got a sample of shade 180 and 200 to make sure it was the right shade before buying.

This formula dries FAST, so apply one section at a time and blend quickly! 3. A little goes a long way! 2-3 pumps should cover your entire face. Don't get too much, or you might look cakey!

I dot small areas of my face then use my beauty blender- it dries very fast so do not dot your whole face then try and blend!!

I always have had trouble finding my foundation colour with brands at sephora, but this matched me perfectly and I'm sure girls at the darker end of the spectrum will love the shade selection just as much.\n",

      "I wasn’t sure if I wanted to try this at first because I find that usually a lot of products have too much hype and then end up not being worth it. However this one is worth the hype. My skin tone to me can be confusing because sometimes I fit good into a medium shade and sometimes better into a light shade due to my yellow undertones with some redness on my cheeks. (I’m Mexican American by the way.) I’ve even purchase the makeup forever chromatic mixes in brown and yellow to change my foundations to what I need because there is hardly a perfect shade for me. When I matched myself online I thought I would be a 190 but when I went in store and they used the color matching machine on me it said I would be a 240! It was a huge difference. So luckily I had a friend with me who aided the girl in trying them on to find my best shade. I ended up with the 180. It was perfect and flawless. I don’t think my skin ever looked like my skin but better. I was so sad to leave the store after finding my shade because no one in San Antonio had it in stock. I waited impatiently for it to be in stock at Sephora and I’m glad i waited. Thank you Rihanna for making the perfect foundation for me! ***one thing I learned from this foundation is to always shake it before using it. Yes I know it says so on the box but I didn’t read it till after I attempted the application of he foundation till after two uses and was confused about how it covered weirdly. It also dries fast when you fab it on so it must be blended immediately.\n",

      "I bought this foundation when it first came out because of all the hype. I bought the shade that matched my perfect shade (MUF Y235) and it oxidized SO BADLY that it didn't match my neck at all. Also, I understand it is a matte foundation, but it felt so uncomfortable on my face - it felt like it dried down similar to mud. I stopped using this foundation after 2 uses and I just threw it away the other day because I never use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "This foundation is really beautiful. I've used it in conjunction with the pro filter primer. This foundation dries into a demi matte finish (not too drying) and looks flawless on the skin. Many matte foundations emphasize my texture and other flaws, but this just sits on the skin beautifully and never settles or gets crusty. It has medium coverage but is buildable. The shade is perfect as well, which is the first time this has happened! even in other brands with many shade ranges, i have never found a foundation that matches both my color and preferred formula. For reference, I have combination skin with hyper pigmentation and mild acne. This does have a scent to it which lingered a while after application, but it didn't break me out so i will gladly continue to use this. WARNING: this oxidizes. its a must to use a shade lighter. I don't mind since it doesn't continue to oxidize all day, once it sets to the shade it will oxidize to it will stay that way. i recommend grabbing a sample of a couple shades and seeing which shade oxidizes to match you best. I also always use this with a beauty blender.\n",

      "I have this foundation in 410. I originally bought 420, but it was too orange. I have dark skin with golden undertones. You really must go in store to match. It is going to be extremely difficult to pick a color from online swatches. I really like this foundation. I'm amazed at how matte it is and remains throughout the day. I am oily and after 4 hours of wear, I still don't need to blot. It's the first foundation that makes me think I can get away without setting it with powder (I do, of course!). The very thin formula makes it very lightweight and capable of building up to fuller coverage and still look like skin. It will cling to dry patches so you may want to avoid if you have dry skin, or be sure to moisturize and prime with hydrating primer before application. And finally, I can't not mention the fact that Rihanna released 40 shades! Incredible and unheard of. Brava, Rihanna! I've worn this foundation for two days straight since purchasing it and both days I received compliments from people who have seen me many times previously. I will definitely be adding to my stable of foundations.\n",

      "The colour matches me really well, but other than that I don’t like this product. I have dry skin and the foundation looks splotchy on my face. It looks cakey and like I’m wearing tons of makeup. I mixed my face lotion with it and then it looked ok, but I still had to blend it like crazy... Over all I regret buying this. So save your coin!!!!\n",

      "190 is the perfect match for me which is nice because I feel like so often I have a hard time getting a really close/ perfect match. I figured this was one of those overly hyped celebrity products but I figured I'd give it a chance and I'm glad I did. I don't really have textured skin so I don't have issues with pores or dry patches which some people say they deal with. I like the finish, it's not dry or oily and it has good coverage. It looks like skin, not like cake...with that being said, it looks HORRIBLE if you try to layer it so work quickly once you place it down and build up the spots that need it really fast. There is a lot of talk about oxidation and it doesn't oxidize on me, it dries down so it starts off a little lighter than it ends up drying down to but it doesn't change throughout the day. I would recommend this product.\n",

      "I REALLY wanted to like this product. I had seen some good reviews and when I color matched it in a store, it was PERFECT. However, the spot where I matched it on my face was the one spot on my forehead that is the smoothest, oiliest, and is also scar free. When I got home it had oxidized in the one spot, and became a bit to yellow, but that didn't bother me (I am very fair skinned and have patches that are more pinky and some that are definitely more yellow, so sometimes one undertone works better than the other). It was also a little warm in my car so I did sweat a bit on my forehead, so it seemed fairly moist looking at that time. When I got home, as I wanted to try how it wore thought the day, I cleaned, primed, and started to put the foundation on. It was a nightmare (probably felt worse because I really wanted to like this product). It dries too quickly, and becomes hard to blend after a few seconds (damp sponge, brush, and finger, all the same). As I tried to fix that, I noticed it accentuated all of my acne and chicken pox scars (I have some big pox scars on my cheek that don't cover easily). I finished the whole face, and I looked like a piece of white chalk that was next to a piece of yellow chalk, my skin looked and felt DRY. It was very hard to look at my face and feel good about it. I had a friend (going through cosmetology courses) come over, who also thought it looked bad, and she tried some things to see if she could get it to work, and if it didn't accentuate my pores, I looked to dry. Nothing worked, and I after it oxidized, it was to yellow or dark and no longer matched. My friend tried it, and it did work well for her, as she has normal/oily skin, but my color was too light (after oxidizing). For me, it was to dry for my skin, and the oxidizing was strange (maybe a miss batch bottle?). But my friend did get some and she loves it. But for really dry, and scarred skin, it was a sad miss.

It goes on and it's basically already blended. No need to set either, it sets itself. I've worn it for about three days solid now and it doesn't move or wear off.

Even with the primer and more moisturizer, I couldn’t get this foundation to work on my dry skin. The positives of this product was that it almost completely hides redness, photographs really well, and feels lightweight on my skin.

My skin is ridiculously oily and this foundation does not move ONE INCH. This lasted me all day through work, a nap, and a night out. I did not have to reapply at all. I tend to go for lighter coverage because I don't like to feel like my makeup is caked on. The coverage is great and easily buildable without feeling thick or cakey. Stays matte all day, but I still have a glow. The range of shades is magic, I have never had a foundation match me so well. A lot of people say that this foundation oxidizes, but it doesn't really. It gets a tad darker about a minute after application, once it's set on the skin, but other than that the color stayed the same. TL;DR - highly recommend, it's perfect, buy it.\n",

Beware of the dry down...I was lucky in that I swatched three shades in store and was able to match from there, but they do seem to darken a bit from what the color looks like in the bottle. Pretty happy with the wear time too. Applied at 7am and was still looking good at 5:30 pm. Overall, super happy with the product and will continue to throw my money at this company\n"
