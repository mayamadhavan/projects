I have dry skin, but not like mega dry, somewhere between dry and normal but this foundation caked on me so bad and stuck to every single dry part of my face like glue. I tried a variety of different primers, made sure to moisturize with the best products, tried a brush and a sponge, and nothing worked. With that being said, I really liked the quality of the product, just not how it worked for me. If Rihanna continues to create more foundation possibly in a more dry skin friendly formula id definitely purchase. Food for thought!\n",

Even with the primer and more moisturizer, I couldn’t get this foundation to work on my dry skin. The positives of this product was that it almost completely hides redness, photographs really well, and feels lightweight on my skin. I plan to return it since I have tried it 4 times with the same results. Maybe Rihanna will release a hydrating formula for dry skin in the future - I would love to try that.\n",

Second, shake foundation bottle very well for long lasting effect. I've worn it for the past two weeks and have received many compliments on how natural my makeup looks. This foundation is superior to others I've tried for combination oily skin like mine because it dries up matte and powdery which for one allows me to totally skip on translucent powder and keeps oiliness at bay for at least 8 hours. I've even worn it on sweltering humid weather in which I tend to blot my face more than usual to dry my sweaty face and the foundation stays intact.

I don't really have textured skin so I don't have issues with pores or dry patches which some people say they deal with. I like the finish, it's not dry or oily and it has good coverage. It looks like skin, not like cake...with that being said, it looks HORRIBLE if you try to layer it so work quickly once you place it down and build up the spots that need it really fast. There is a lot of talk about oxidation and it doesn't oxidize on me, it dries down so it starts off a little lighter than it ends up drying down to but it doesn't change throughout the day. I would recommend this product.\n",

      "So, the first time I got matched by a sephora rep, she swatched my cheek, let it dry down and i bought it. I should've known better because I have hyperpigmentation around my mouth and also neat mt jawline. The center of my face is lighter than my neck and chest. The foundation came out ashy all over when I put a full face on (420). I went back and tried 450 all over. It's not PERFECT match but it covers everything. If there was a warm shade between 440 and 450, that would be me but I can definitely get away with it by doing a little highlighting. Overall, it literally covers everything , didnt need to prime or set OR conceal. Mind you, I have combination oily skin and my forehead gets especially shiny. I have some hyperpigmentation like I said but I don't have many blemishes and my skin doesn't have a lot of texture so I don't know how it pans out on other types aside from reviews. It applies well with both beauty blender and the fenty foundation brush which I use for highlighting as well. It dries down fast so work in small sections and build to the coverage you want. Most of the darker shades (My shade and beyond) are pretty red which is the only real issue since not every dark skin black girl has red undertones. I definitely recommend going into the store and testing out shades for yourself before purchase OR find a YouTube beauty blogger with your shade/tone skin and watch them review. You'd get a decent idea from that as well. So just a takeaway, YES worth the money, DON'T need primer, YES it is buildable YES feels skin like, and YES it literally looks like you used a filter for your face!\n",

      "I've had a bunch of foundations before, MUF, Shu, Laura Mercier just to name a few.. but they've always been the major reason that keeps me from applying makeup on a daily basis. Until I found this! It is soooo comfortable, literally feels like nothing. I only use 1 pump for my entire face and a bit extra under eyes, the coverage and finish is beautiful, looks so natural just like skin and has a matte finish. It also holds up for a good 12 hours, and since I have combination dry skin I don't even need to use setting powder on my cheeks now. The only thing to be careful is it does dry down a bit darker than when you first pump it out, so watch out when you choose your shade! I wouldn't buy it without getting a sample to see how it actually looks on your face when it dries.\n",

      "I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION! When I wear it it is a very nice matte. Not overly matte or too dewy. It makes my skin look like a better version of itself. I was kind of hesitant to try it, but I got a color match in Sephora and 160 blended really perfectly into my skin tone. Usually I have more yellow undertones when it comes to foundation, and in this description it says it has a peachy undertone but I don't think it's too peachy, only the slightest in my opinion. With one application total my face was medium coverage, and I builded it up for full coverage. I did not experience any creasing at all but I typically avoid putting a lot of foundation in my smile lines anyway. It is very lightweight and does not feel cakey at ALL! Since this foundation does dry fairly quickly, what I do is I pump a bit on my finger to place it on my skin and then use a beauty blender to blend it out. From what I've experienced with foundations in general this really helps when you have to move quickly. I used this in my normal face routine as well because I really wanted to see how it would hold up, primer, color corrector, foundation, powder, and it looked beautiful. The bottle itself feels very nice and heavy like more expensive foundations feel like, looks very chic, and I honestly have no complaints that I could give, I highly recommend that you at least get a sample of this or try it out in store- well worth it!!! :)\n"

      "I was really excited for this foundation to launch; however, for me the only thing this foundation has a benefit of is color range. I have normal skin and even with fully prepped and primed skin this foundation looked horrible on my skin. It literally aged me 8-10yrs older. It created these very pronounced lines across my cheeks, smile lines and under the eye, that I don't have. All pores were easily seen once applied. I only had it on for a couple minutes for this to happen. It created and stuck to what looked like \"dry\" patches that weren't really there. Such a shame because it's color range is terrific, it just does not look good on me. From other beauty who have tried this, I've found that this foundation is very hit or miss; people I've talked to either love it or hate it.

My skin did not like this; it made me look nearly 10 years older, accentuating lines and made my skin look dry AF. My skin has never looked this bad with a foundation. So, so disappointed.

Negative attributes are that it dries VERY quickly, so I have to pump it directly on my face instead of my hand, and it looks cakey in photos (I usually don’t put a lot). A mistake that I had with this product is that I used the color IQ I got during the summer and bought that shade in the winter, so it’s darker than me and I have to blend it into my collarbone area so it doesn’t look totally off.

I highly recommend getting the primer to go with it if you have any texture or large pores on your face. 2. If you have dry skin like myself, definitely moisturize! It can be a bit drying since it is a matte finish. Your dry patches will show up. 3. Less is definitely more when it comes to this foundation. You only need a few pumps. I wouldn't try to build it up to full coverage. It's definitely more of a light to medium coverage. If you need more coverage use a brush instead of a sponge. 4. If you have a lot of acne scarring and imperfections this may not be for you. Like I said it's more of a light to medium foundation. Building it up to full coverage makes it look Cakey.\n",

I know there are you tube videos out there to the contrary, but this foundation performs spectacularly ALL DAY (even 12 hour plus days) for me on my oily T zone. Barely any shine and everything stays in place. High quality product that is worth the buy.\n",

I have combination/oily skin, and I tend to get oily around my nose mostly, but this foundation does not make me oily at all. I have a toddler, so I do my makeup early in the morning before she wakes up, I had it on from about 7:30 AM and take it off around 7 or 8 PM, if I'm not going anywhere else and this foundation stayed put and looked amazing even at the end of the day! I used the CoverFX translucent powder to set my whole face and bake underneath my eyes, so I'm sure the powder helped, however don't let that story you, because this foundation is pure gold. I'm shade #150, Latina, with fair skin with neutral undertones. Trust me, you won't regret buying this!\n",

      "This replaced my KVD Lock It foundation. This foundation lasts ALL DAY for me! I am super oily and I have long work days and need a long lasting foundation. This is the best one I have tried so far! I use the Murad mattifying moisturizer and Cover Fx mattifying primer. I use a stippling brush to apply and then blend out with a beauty blender. I lightly set with a translucent powder and a setting spray. It makes my skin look flawless, even when I have break outs. I love the way it smells, not perfumey just a subtle scent, but it doesnt linger. There is very very little to no transfer for me. It does not come off until I wash it off! I wear this for 15 hours and it looks great pretty much the whole time! I will definitely continue to buy!!! Highly recommend! Learn to work with it! I have had no issues, it is amazingggg!!\n",

      "Sort of reminds me of liquid lipstick... The color is great, the pigment concentration is awesome, and it's definitely full-cover and long-lasting - but it dries out my skin immediately. My skin literally cracks and starts peeling. I do have combination skin, and maybe the primer helps? I've tried other primers with this, but not the Fenty one. Right now, when I want to use it, I mix it with a bit of my Make Up For Ever foundation, and apply using a beauty blender instead of putting it directly on to my skin first and then blending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wanted to love this but I'm returning it. This is NOT for dry girls and boys. I tried it with the Fenty blender and the Fenty Beauty brush (which is absolutely fantastic, btw). The brush applied the foundation better than the blender by far but in both cases, it was patchy, required a TON of product and took forever to blend out. Most importantly, the results were okay at best. It's probably also worth mentioning that I moisturized, let that set, and then primed with a moisturizing primer before applying this on one side, and applied a more basic primer on the other. Both sides were a bit of a mess. My ONLY skin issues are dryness and a little bit of redness--no acne, not acne prone, and even then the coverage was meh. I believe this foundation does wonders for some people but if you're dry, you're gonna have to jump through a few hoops to make this work. Who has time for that ;(\n",

      "I absolutely adore this foundation, best I have tried yet. It is a matte finish which I didn't think i would like since I prefer dewy but oh this is beautiful. I wear it with Becca filter primer (purple one) as I found the Fenty beauty primer was way to drying with this, however if you are very oily you will like to use both. I dot small areas of my face then use my beauty blender- it dries very fast so do not dot your whole face then try and blend!! Looks beautiful, Im sure you dont need to powder this but i do anyways (chin, nose) since i can get both oily and dry. Also no breakouts!! Yay! So worth the purchase :,)\n",

      "After hearing everyone rave about this, I had to try it immediately! I went to Sephora and got a sample last night, and wore it all day today. The shade definitely oxidized a bit, so I think I should have gotten a slightly lighter sample. As far as application goes, it dries down VERY quickly. I only use matte foundation and this one definitely dries faster than any I've ever used, which made it a little tricky to apply. The wear was pretty good but I don't feel like it blurred my pores like everyone says it does and I still had to blot my face every 3-4 hours like I usually do. I still prefer my L'Oréal pro matte foundation, which is my holy grail.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the first time I got matched by a sephora rep, she swatched my cheek, let it dry down and i bought it. I should've known better because I have hyperpigmentation around my mouth and also neat mt jawline. The center of my face is lighter than my neck and chest. The foundation came out ashy all over when I put a full face on (420). I went back and tried 450 all over. It's not PERFECT match but it covers everything. If there was a warm shade between 440 and 450, that would be me but I can definitely get away with it by doing a little highlighting. Overall, it literally covers everything , didnt need to prime or set OR conceal. Mind you, I have combination oily skin and my forehead gets especially shiny. I have some hyperpigmentation like I said but I don't have many blemishes and my skin doesn't have a lot of texture so I don't know how it pans out on other types aside from reviews. It applies well with both beauty blender and the fenty foundation brush which I use for highlighting as well. It dries down fast so work in small sections and build to the coverage you want. Most of the darker shades (My shade and beyond) are pretty red which is the only real issue since not every dark skin black girl has red undertones. I definitely recommend going into the store and testing out shades for yourself before purchase OR find a YouTube beauty blogger with your shade/tone skin and watch them review. You'd get a decent idea from that as well. So just a takeaway, YES worth the money, DON'T need primer, YES it is buildable YES feels skin like, and YES it literally looks like you used a filter for your face!\n",

      "I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION! When I wear it it is a very nice matte. Not overly matte or too dewy. It makes my skin look like a better version of itself. I was kind of hesitant to try it, but I got a color match in Sephora and 160 blended really perfectly into my skin tone. Usually I have more yellow undertones when it comes to foundation, and in this description it says it has a peachy undertone but I don't think it's too peachy, only the slightest in my opinion. With one application total my face was medium coverage, and I builded it up for full coverage. I did not experience any creasing at all but I typically avoid putting a lot of foundation in my smile lines anyway. It is very lightweight and does not feel cakey at ALL! Since this foundation does dry fairly quickly, what I do is I pump a bit on my finger to place it on my skin and then use a beauty blender to blend it out. From what I've experienced with foundations in general this really helps when you have to move quickly. I used this in my normal face routine as well because I really wanted to see how it would hold up, primer, color corrector, foundation, powder, and it looked beautiful. The bottle itself feels very nice and heavy like more expensive foundations feel like, looks very chic, and I honestly have no complaints that I could give, I highly recommend that you at least get a sample of this or try it out in store- well worth it!!! :)\n",

      "190 is the perfect match for me which is nice because I feel like so often I have a hard time getting a really close/ perfect match. I figured this was one of those overly hyped celebrity products but I figured I'd give it a chance and I'm glad I did. I don't really have textured skin so I don't have issues with pores or dry patches which some people say they deal with. I like the finish, it's not dry or oily and it has good coverage. It looks like skin, not like cake...with that being said, it looks HORRIBLE if you try to layer it so work quickly once you place it down and build up the spots that need it really fast. There is a lot of talk about oxidation and it doesn't oxidize on me, it dries down so it starts off a little lighter than it ends up drying down to but it doesn't change throughout the day. I would recommend this product.\n",

It dries almost instantly, making it hard to buff and easy to cake on. I also noticed that the foundation would wear away on parts of my face and seem patchy. Even with the primer and more moisturizer, I couldn’t get this foundation to work on my dry skin. The positives of this product was that it almost completely hides redness, photographs really well, and feels lightweight on my skin. I plan to return it since I have tried it 4 times with the same results. Maybe Rihanna will release a hydrating formula for dry skin in the future - I would love to try that.\n",
