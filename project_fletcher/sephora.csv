0,creecreex,Brown,Brunette,Deep,Normal,Cellulite,370,"I have 370 and I got matched at Sephora. I like to wait for it to oxidize before I fully blend it in. I’m yellow with a tiny bit of other warm undertones and my word, I’ve never had anything match me SO well. It’s comfortable. It’s not drying. It’s perfect all around and is now my only foundation I use. Thank you, Riri!",1,0,14,100

2,bloodyblondie,Blue,Black,Porcelain,Dry,Blackheads,100,"I was so nervous about trying this product because of my dry skin and I'm really picky about coverage. I hate full coverage cause I like to show off my freckles a little and look more natural, but I'd like to cover up my dark circles as well so this was PERFECT! I wanted 110 but since im really fair skinned, I get even more fair in wintertime so I went with 100. Totally recommend this!! lasts so long. I use argan oil right before I apply this foundation so it doesnt dry up on my face too fast and so it could set properly. I'm also acne prone and have some blemishes here and there...this covers it up comfortably without any caking up. No creasing, no rubbing off, totally in love.",1,0,5,100
3,miralanani,Brown,Brunette,Medium,Combination,Acne,270,This product was amazing! Just fell in love! Tip: dot down once or twice! Not too much because the coverage is flawless! Totally recommend for those who are worried with dry skin...this is for you.,1,0,5,100

I have oily skin and this actually goes well with my skin type. I’m in love with this foundation. I usually get the tarte foundation but this is my favorite one when I’d wanna go out and have some fun and would want it to be there for a long time!! Btw, it oxidizes as you put it!!",1,0,13,100
7,Shortcake92,Brown,Black,Deep,Oily,Blackheads,410,"Wonderful coverage with just one pump. Went on wonderfully, resisted my oils, and didn't crease in my smile lines. 13 hours of wear with the hourglass primer and laura mercier deep setting powder.",1,1,44,100
8,sarina05,Brown,Brunette,Medium,Combination,Acne,240,"THIS FOUNDATION IS AMAZZING. I have lots of acne and acne scarring and this covered EVERYTHING. I also have oily skin and I did not get oily in it. It is a matte foundation though and if you have dry skin, I would proceed in caution because it might be a little drying, but if you have oily or combo skin I definitely recommend this !",1,15,278,100
9,cocoabean16,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Blackheads,430,This is an awesome product! I wear this each and every day. I work in a busy ER for 12 hours a day. I don’t have time to touch up my face throughout the day. This has a natural airbrushed look to it that never has me looking overly made up. I can usually use a tissue to blot my t zone and that’s enough. This shade blends with my complexion beautifully. No blemishes or spots are visible. The only issue I have with this foundation is that it does transfer very easily so be careful when hugging people because it may get onto their clothes. I usually wore Lancôme but this is my daily go to.,1,5,92,100
10,JDhome89,Brown,Brunette,Light,Oily,Acne,190,"If you’re oily, this foundation is amazing! Full coverage, it covers and evens me out completely. Will 100% repurchase. 110% recommends to my fellow oily gals and guys!!!",1,1,18,100
11,TaylorRenee511,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Acne,410,A light-weight full coverage foundation. I normally apply with a beauty blender which I believe applies the foundation the smoothest. Other foundations tend to bring out the oiliness in my skin but this foundation kept it more under control. It also provides a nice coverage on my dark marks without looking cakey. Would definitely recommend!,1,9,153,80
12,outerspaceglow,Green,Brunette,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,120,"I've had this foundation for a little while now, and I've tried it with enough primer/powder combos to see what really works. The shade range is definitely a huge plus; 120 is the PERFECT neutral shade for my skin, and it doesn't turn orange on me. It just darkens the slightest bit when it dries down, but it's not noticeable on my skin. The trickiest part of this foundation is applying it, because it dries down so quickly that it can easily look patchy. I've found that if I apply it on my face with a foundation brush in broad strokes (almost like you apply a stick foundation) and then blend it out with a beauty sponge, it has the nicest, skin-like finish with a medium-to-full coverage. This is definitely one of those foundations that needs prepping with a primer, powder and setting spray, or else it won't hold up as well. However, I can say the same for most of my foundations. It took me a while to work with it, and I wanted to work with it because I love the shade and I really want to support the Fenty brand. It's a great special-occasion foundation because it gives the skin a smooth, even finish while still being lightweight. And, considering that it's not as expensive as other high-end foundations, I say it's worth a shot.",1,4,67,80
13,Carrlien,Green,Brunette,Olive,Combination,Dark circles,240,"Very great on the skin and makes me look so flawless. I’ve always been complimented on my brows or how pretty my eyeshadow is but never my foundation until I used this one. It gives a very professional look. Only con is that this is a matte foundation, so if you have dry skin already this is not for you. I had a problem with my nose but that is all, just find out which primer benefits you most to help.",1,7,110,100
14,comfortrose,Brown,Black,Ebony,Oily,Acne,490,"There aren’t many mainstream brands that cater to my skin tone. I know people like to talk about MUFE and CoverFX and Lancôme having extensive shade ranges, which they do, but none of them go deep enough to have a shade for me. I love this foundation mainly because it is a perfect match for me. It does oxidize darker and more neutral than the initial colour when applied. It’s an awesome foundation for oily skin and other products sit perfectly on top of the foundation. I would definitely recommend if you can get your shade match.",1,3,47,100
15,PixiePuddinPie,Hazel,Red,Porcelain,Dry,Acne,110,"I was reluctant to try this, because jumping onto the trend of celebrities’ makeup brands just isn’t my thing. However, when I saw that this was sweat & humidity resistant & that it allegedly comes in every shade “from porcelain to ebony,” I decided to take it out for a test drive, not expecting much. I was extremely pleasantly surprised, & if only it hadn’t been difficult finding a primer that didn’t cause it to be flaky-splotchy on my rather dry skin, I would have whole-heartedly given it 5 stars. Pros: 1) when they said porcelain, they meant porcelain! I wear shade 42 in Kat Von D (which actually adds a tiny bit of colour - I’m slightly paler than it, but the undertones in 41 make me look dead), 00 in the Bobbi Brown stick (it also adds a hint of colour to my pallor); beyond those two, I have to mix the palest of pinks & whites into any foundation to be able to wear it w/o looking weirdly unnatural. However, shade 110 was PERFECT on me. I would never have believed the range would include shades light enough for me! 2) it’s long-wear without feeling heavy. KvD foundation will last through everything, but I can feel it on my skin. Urban Decay’s All Nighter is swim-proof, but the lightest shade (0.5) oxidises WAY too dark on me, & it, too, feels a bit heavy. While the Fenty doesn’t have the same insane degree of coverage as those two w/ 1 layer (I haven’t yet tried building it up to the full coverage as those provide with 1 thin coat), & I haven’t yet tried swimming in it, it DOES stand up to a whole day under hot lights AND it withstood several hours at the barn horseback riding, grooming, & SWEATING in the Miami, FL heat/humidity. 3) The finish is gorgeous (over the right primer). It really is a soft-filtered soft matte that doesn’t look cakey. It looks like naked skin viewed through an Instagram-type filter. 4) It feels weightless. CONS: There’s only 1 con I’ve seen-it clung to dry patches & flaked unless I used a super moisturising primer.",1,26,392,80
16,Meowwkikii,Blue,Blonde,Porcelain,Combination,Sensitivity,110,I have rosacea and very fair skin. This is the first foundation that has ever matched my skin color. NO UNDER CHIN AND NECK BLENDING!,1,1,15,100
17,shelbyls123,Hazel,Blonde,Fair,Oily,Acne,140,"I have been using this foundation daily. It has a perfect amount of coverage for me and has looked nice on my oily/acne prone skin. But, I have a few issues with it-I have had a hard time finding the right color for me since it oxidizes so quickly. It also dries really quickly so you have to apply it quickly on the face before it's completely dry. I wouldn't recommend this product for people with dry skin though!",1,12,180,80
18,Nicoledesaint,Green,Blonde,Tan,Normal,Redness,130,"I was in Sephora the other day and a lady dropped this foundation on accident and it shattered everywhere and got all over my legs. I just rubbed it in and went on with my day. After my full day of adventures including working out, going swimming AND going out dancing later that night, I came home to see that the foundation on my legs was still perfectly there. I didn’t even notice it until I took a closer later that night! Not only did this foundation hold its title for long wear, it color matched my skin perfectly! HOW CRAZY IS THIS!!! Long story short I highly recommend it and am on my way to sephora right now to get my own bottle of it!",1,1,15,100
19,KungFuKeya,Brown,Black,Deep,Dry,Dullness,410,Yeas I love this foundation so much! It photographs beautifully and doesn't budge once it sets. My favorite part about this foundation is that it doesn't make me look ashy or casket ready. My face is significantly darker than my neck and chest and usually when I try to get a foundation that matched my neck I look ghostly. This foundation still looks like my skin even though it is lighter than my face! The first time I wore it was for a night out and let me tell you it lasted all night without settling into my lines. I ended up accidentally passing out with my face on and when I woke up I was shook when my make up was still SNATCHED! I got a tad oily in my t-zone but whoa even my highlight (trophy wife and Moscow mule) was sitting! New staple item for sure! It's so light too and doesn't transfer like crazy. Tip: apply one side at a time and don't swirl into the skin!! This stuff dries quick af and might streak on you if you swirl it .... pat it into to the skin instead.,1,25,351,100

21,alaska5000,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,170,I absolutely LOVE this foundation. It's amazingly priced and you get a little bit more product than other standard foundations.

22,TyraS,Brown,Black,Dark,Oily,Acne,430,"I LOVE this foundation! It’s exactly what the title says; lightweight, matte, longwear. Your color might look too light in the bottle and when you pump it on your face but it oxidizes to your PERFECT color so don’t go darker/lighter. I bought 430, it was perfect! It doesn’t feel heavy at all or greasy/oily. I could use this everyday! (I have oily skin large pores around nose/ acne prone skin)",1,30,408,100

25,Rika2021,Brown,Black,Dark,Oily,Acne,430,"This has to be the BEST foundation I have ever used! I blotted once mid day and remained matte for the rest of the day. If you are super oily, I recommend using the blot powder over the primer, then apply foundation for a more matte look.",1,6,79,100
26,jess5984,Green,Brunette,Medium,Dry,Aging,260,"I was really skeptical about this foundation bc I have very dry skin and every time I wear a matte foundation it just makes my skin look so dull. But, one of my co workers was wearing this foundation one day and her skin looked flawless so I figured I would give it a shot. When I first applied this I didn't like it at all... I didn't like how it dried so fast and I didn't like how my skin felt... it felt dry and tight but I wore it through the day and I have to say Im really impressed. Usually by the end of the day my makeup looks worn out but the day I wore this my makeup looked the same as it did that morning! I have never had a foundation do that before. Im going to try mixing in some facial oil with the foundation just to see if it makes it more of a satin finish on my skin instead of so matte but either way Im keeping it! I hate touching up my makeup during the day and having my skin feel a little tight is worth not having to worry about touch ups during the day.",1,3,39,80

The shade range is absolutely amazing and I'm so happy that this launched. I can't wait to see where this brand goes in the future. I added a picture of me in the foundation.

I picked up the very last shade in a sample and was genuinely shooketh'd that that it was too dark rather than too light; how refreshing! I picked up the correct shade and tested it from 8am to 10pm and literally forgot I was wearing it (i was wearing just the foundation, no other products) and almost didn't wash it off before bed; it's that lightweight!

30,samx99,Brown,Black,Light,Oily,Acne,180,Really helped me look so amazing on a holiday couple days ago. (Eid) It’s affordable as well! I haven’t had any acne breakout as of yet. I got so many compliments for how I looked. I love this product.,1,5,60,100
31,Marianny24,Brown,Black,Light,Dry,Acne,250,Absolutely upset that this didn't work for me. I love Rihanna and I was super excited to use this. I will start with the pros 1. $34 I mean great price 2. Packaging is so elegant and it just feels expensive 3. The range of shades is phenomenal. When I walked into Sephora the same day it came out all of the warm shades were sold out. So glad a foundation line has become so diverse and inclusive of many more skin tones. The cons: unfortunately I have dry skin and this formula just did not work for me. It dries very quickly and made me look very patchy and cakes. I knew it was matte but I figured if I moisturized and primed well it would be fine but it wasn't. Another con is that it oxidizes so I was way darker than how I got matched at the store and it made my face look too orange. Getting this product people may want to try a shade or a few down. Still love Rihanna so sad this didn't work for me. Hopefully she will come out with something more Dewey for those of us that have dry skin.,0,14,164,60
32,AngelaRoman,Brown,Black,Olive,Oily,Acne,300,"Hands down one of the best foundations I have tried! I have an extremely oily T-zone and dark spots on my cheeks from acne, not only did this foundation cover it completely but it also didn't emphasize any texture I have!! I did try it in store before purchasing and got several samples to make sure I had the correct shade, after it oxidized. To me it's light weight and gives a medium to full coverage. It works well with all my other makeup too (concealer, setting powder, highlight, bronzer, blush, etc.)!",1,11,127,100
33,jaetrelle,Brown,Black,Dark,Oily,Unknown,430,I so love this foundation. It's full coverage and drives quickly. I put it on early morning and it lasts me all day with minimal touch ups.

34,skylernoel,Hazel,Black,Porcelain,Oily,Acne,100,"I honestly expected to love this foundation, but it ended up being the worst foundation I’ve used. I have oily skin and large pores, so I thought this would live up to the hype and make my skin look flawless. It creased horribly, emphasized my already large pores, and dried too quickly for my liking. The price is not bad, but in my experience, it’s not worth the $34.",0,2,23,20
35,kitosgift,Brown,Brunette,Deep,Combination,Cuticles,360,"Definitely not for me. The first time I went into Sephora, I was matched with 370. I received a sample, but didn't love it. I went back in to try again, and was told I was a match with 360. I have tan skin with warm undertones, so I was a bit surprised, but I went along with it. Everything seemed okay in store. I let it oxidize and whatnot while I looked at other products. When I checked in the mirror, everything seemed okay. I want to say that this was not the best lit Sephora, but that I was going off what I could see and what the Sephora employee who helped me could see. I would've used my selfie case with built in light to check it out, but I left it at home. I bought it anyway. I get home, I look in the mirror, and I look SUPER ashy! I tried a few more times to see how it would look, but each time I looked extremely ashy. I had to take it back. When I spoke to a different employee, she explained that Rihanna is extremely oily, and thus her foundation is made for those with similar skin. I wish I would've known that! There are other products in the line that I really like, but I just can't do the foundation.",0,3,33,20
36,tyoha,Brown,Brunette,Fair,Combination,Acne,230,"I really wanted to love this foundation but it is just not for me. It dried very matte to the point where my face seemed flat. I have combination skin and this foundation clinged to every dry spot, pores or fines lines. It was so dry I had a hard time applying powder blush and highlighter. But the real deal breaker was how bad it oxidized. It goes full on orange. I put it on and in less than an hour I can see a harsh line on my neck. The foundation dries in seconds so I know it’s not how the “final color” is supposed to be. It gets way too orange anyway. Before buying this foundation you should take a sample home and test it out a couple times to see if this is the foundation for you.",1,7,76,40

I have oily skin and never have been able to find a foundation that not only fights against the oil, but stays put PERFECTLY all. day. long. I don't think I will ever buy another foundation again after using Fenti! The shade range is also a huge bonus!! It does oxidize a little bit, but just sample it before you commit to an entire bottle so that you get your shade just right. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND",1,7,76,100

39,Fluffyhead,Brown,Brunette,Fair,Oily,Acne,150,"(The photo is freshly swiped on top of dried foundation) I bought this foundation, with primer, after receiving a sample. This foundation is a nice “medium” in multiple ways: a middle ground between sheer and full coverage, and a price point less than many upscale foundations (without being cheap). The coverage is matte with a bit of glow. It seems to enhance my pores, which may just be a quality of heavier coverage foundation — I’m admittedly more experienced in lighter ones like UD’s Naked. After application, my skin is smooth, like powdery smooth... a bit dry feeling, which is fine for me as an adult plagued with teenage (i.e. oily) skin. It does a great job of covering my dark and red spots without having to pile on concealer. My biggest complaints seems to echo other reports: the undertone is surprisingly yellow for a “neutral.” I usually buy “warm” foundation, so that this neutral is a bit too warm is unexpected. Secondly, the shade deepens noticably after it dries. What seemed like a perfect match on application is now a shade too dark and a hint too yellow. For context, I’m a pale white woman who is thirty-something (ok, 39.5). I have a warm yellow undertone but also a lot of pink in my cheeks. I love that Rihanna has made this foundation inclusive for all people, which makes me really want this foundation to work for me. I would recommend anyone purchasing this foundation go to a Sephora in person (if lucky to be near one) and try the samples in and around your shade, regardless of your previous labels. Give it ten minutes and then come back to the mirror. If you find the right match, you’ve found yourself a good foundation at a good price. Congratulations.",1,20,214,80

41,purpledrank,Brown,Black,Tan,Dry,Aging,300,"This is a high maintenance foundation. I have very dry skin, no acne, and usually poreless. So my preference for foundation is usually dewy, luminous, and hydrating. This foundation is meant for our oily-skin men and women. So if you have dry skin like me, don't turn away just yet! With a proper moisturizer and primer (I use ladykin cactus aqua cream and J.one Jelly pack as primer), this foundation will wear beautifully. It feels like skin. No tackiness. Matte all day. Does not crease or budge. No settling into pores or wrinkles. However, you must work quickly when applying. The Foundation will dry quickly and does NOT require powder to prime or set your makeup. The color is buildable from medium to full coverage. I recommend starting off in sections, blend, and then move on to the other of the face. The foundation does not oxidize but is like paint. The color is brighter when wet but will dry darker on the skin. This is easily remedied with a shade lighter foundation or concealer/contouring. Just get matched and buy it. You will not be disappointed.",1,13,137,100

43,AlinaMara,Blue,Brunette,Light,Combination,Aging,180,"FULL DISCLOSURE: when I first tried this, I hated it! BUT I tried it a few times and realized I was doing it wrong! This is a post for all the ladies who don't usually use full coverage foundation or just hated the foundation after trying it out. OK so when I first tried this, all of my texture was visible. My face looked horrible, dry, and cakey/chalky. I couldn't figure out what they hype was... 'til I did the following: 1. Shake the bottle well. Like really really well. 2. Make sure you're priming and tapping in the primer to help shrink up your pores 3. Less is more. I put on way too much and it looked bad. Now I put on 2 pumps for my whole face (sometimes 3) The biggest key is definitely to use less. And focus on the middle of your face dragging out. So put all your dots of foundation on the middle of your face, none along the outside, then work them in (gently) and drag it out so the edges of your face have less foundation. You have to be gentle and take some extra time being nice to your face, but it's worth it. I figured this out when I watched the actual Fenty Beauty video where her makeup artist applies it to her face. That is how he explains to do it! I hope this helps some people! Because this foundation really truly does make you look airbrushed! Riri killed it!",1,336,513,100

The product is so fluid and the coverage is amazing. Recommendation for dry skin - I'd highly recommend the Clinque Moisture Surge as a moisturizer followed by the Two Face Hangover Primer. This combo works great for my skin and lets the foundation do it's job properly. Recommendation for color selection - Highly recommended getting a shade lighter than your ColorID as this does oxidize. My ColorID is actually 2Y11. Fenty 310 is a shade lighter than what my ""true colour"" is but, it works out much better. As my ""true colour"" was much too yellow.",1,6,62,80
46,nattylouise87,Blue,Brunette,Fair,Dry,Acne,150,"I was hesitant to try this at first, due to all the reviews stating it wouldn't work for dry skin. I am so sick of either looking like a ghost or a peach, though, that when I found myself walking past a Sephora, I decided to give it a go. Firstly, if you are like me and prone to dry skin, especially over winter, you will want to make sure you moisturise first. If I don't moisturise regularly (and liberally before using this foundation), it does look terrible as it sets. However, this has actually encouraged me to keep on top of my skin care routine, and my skin is feeling less tight and dry as a result. So that's a good indirect result of this foundation. ;) As for the foundation itself, I am in love. My skin is fair and freckled, but the freckles on my forehead are light, so I really just look like I have splotchy skin, especially where they have converged into a mothership on my forehead. This foundation manages to even out my skin tone and, at the same time, let some of my freckles show through, so I still look like me. It sets quickly and feels like I haven't got any foundation on. The level of coverage is perfect for me and the scent is quite nice, too. It also hasn't irritated my sensitive skin. In terms of application, the salesperson at Sephora made sure I knew to do my face in parts, as this dries very quickly and becomes hard to blend. So I can't apply it exactly as I would my old make up but I also don't have to blend two products together to try to match my face - shade 150 is perfect for my ""summer tan."" All in all I'm very happy with this, I can only hope that they'll come out with the same shades in a version for drier skin types in the future.",1,6,62,80

48,bobtheboss,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Uneven skin tones,390,"It took me a while to find my match for this beautiful Rihanna sent foundation. I originally went in and was matched by Sephora as a 410. I thought the color was off but several employees insisted it was the perfect match. I went home and tried it on once again and had my doubts about it. I went to a different Sephora the next day to grab a few things and to return the wrong contour kit. I am an African American woman with a yellow undertone and warm complexion. The 410 just was waaay too ashy. The lady at the second sephora new this and apololgized for how the other sephora had matched me. She ended up recommending the 400 as my true foundation so I bought it and returned the 410. When i got home in my natural lighting and had seen the terrible orange tent it left on my face, I knew I was over Sephora matching black girls. Many times I have gone in there and they have no idea how to apply make up or recommend certain products that would work. However, I was determined to officially try this new brand that was support an amazing, dominating, and bossy a** woman like Rihanna. So I went in for the third day in a row and finally found the right match after a third lady finally helped me. I was skeptical with 390 after so many attempts to get the right color that I questioned it until I took a picture and seen how flawless my skin looked!! Ladies, Rihanna is giving you all types of matte and glow for DAYZZ! Phuck anyone who says ANYTHING differently, they mad af! lol. She did her thang! I have NEVER seen so many black women happy to try a new product or to FINALLY feel included. Not to mention the product is built for most of our skin types. It's waterproof, sweat proof, and hater proof! lol! Seriouly, the BEST foundation I have had to date! I am happy I waited to find the RIGHT color because it literally feels like you have nothing on. The primer is a MUST as it definitely helps to minimize pores. I am BEYOND happy she provided ample enough product for her fans!",1,82,834,80

The color does deepen a little bit after you put it on but it only takes 2-3 minutes to see the final result. I have an extensive make up collection and have tried x amount of foundations and I have to admit this is my new favorite! However, the finish is very matte which may not be everyone's cup of tea. Either way, amazing product!",1,1,10,100

52,breeziie,Brown,Black,Olive,Combination,Acne,310,"Ok, so I have only used it once since I just got it but I have to admit I instantly fell in love with it. The shade range is ridiculous in the most amazing way! I have this huge issue where no matter what I do foundations do not match my neck but this one did! The coverage is very buildable and it doesn't feel like you have anything on. Another thing I noticed is usually with other foundations it separates on my nose when I start to sweat and this foundation did not do that. All in all I'm really happy with this purchase!!",1,1,10,100
53,mustardrebellio,Blue,Blonde,Light,Combination,Dullness,100,I have tried to make this foundation but I give up! My skin is combination and it accentuates my pores. If I moisturizer it makes a mess and doesn’t stay on the skin at all. This is the worse foundation I’ve ever tried.,0,1,10,40
54,anna2006,Brown,Brunette,Medium,Oily,Acne,190,"I honestly don’t understand how people make this work: I’ve tried with different brushes, beautyblender, and just no! It dries so fast that it won’t let you blend well. You can’t use more than one layer to build up coverage, because when you apply the second layer, the brush lifts and removes the first layer in patches, because that first layer has dried like a mask. Whatever you apply over it will do the same and lift the foundation off of your face, even if applied carefuly with fingers such as concealer or liquid highlighter. I use makeup every single day, and love it! But this, I just can’t!! Cakey, non buildable, hated it!!",0,9,88,20

I started noticing after about 2 weeks of wearing it that my acne situation had gotten much worse. I stopped using it, let my skin clear up and then started using it again to see if maybe it was a fluke. Nope, right back to zit city. This may be a problem that is unique to me and my skin just doesn’t agree with something in the formula, but I have a couple of co-workers who have complained of the same thing while using this product.",1,48,468,60
56,beautyguru244,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,220,"Okay you guys, let me start off by saying I have tried literally every foundation, from cheap drugstore to expensive ysl. Literally anything, I've tried it. I bought this on a whim, I mainly went into Sephora to buy the trophy wife highlighter, but EVERYONE and i mean everyone and their momma's were trying to get their hands on this foundation. Shades were being sold out so quickly so I kind of gave in and figured I'd get it as well. The lady color matched me and the shade is pretty good for my skin (it was a tad bit light, but it's perfect since fall will be here and no more tan-ness). I have oily, acne prone, sensitive skin. Like I literally break out to anything. This foundation does not break me out. Now, let's talk application. This foundation is a thinner consistency (not thick at all like urban decay all nighter and not too thin like urban decay naked skin). It's a nice in between but more on the thin and runny side. 1 pump can cover one side of my face really well (you could get away with using 1 pump on your entire face, but I have lots of acne and scars to cover up). They were out of her foundation brush to use with it so I used the elf flap top powder brush and let me tell yall... the foundation looked so freaking good!!! It didn't look the least bit cakey, I had a high medium almost full coverage, literally covered EVERYTHING, and it looked like skin, looked smooth, and it was such a dream to blend it. You guys seriously need this. I also tried it with a beauty blender and I find it soaks up so much product so I'd stick with a brush. Also, I wore this for 16 hours today and literally still looked so good and I didn't look shiny at all. This is such a game changer. I used smash box photo finish primer and benefit porefessional primer underneath as well as the Mario badescu rose water. This foundation literally looks like it melts into your skin (in a good way). I'm ordering backups because this foundation is bomb dot come.",1,30,292,100
57,Eshaaaa524,Brown,Black,Dark,Normal,Acne,420,This foundation is perfect. I don't think I've ever found a foundation that matches so perfectly.

I'm a oily girl, I wore the foundation by itself without setting it with powder and it performed soooooo good! I suggest going in to your local Sephora and finding your match in store. I thought I would be along the line of 440 or 450 but they both were way to dark. I don't know what kind magic is in this foundation. I watched YouTube videos of people lighter in skin tone and darker in skin tone and both matched to the shade I got.

62,ccelestexo,Brown,Blonde,Medium,Combination,Aging,260,Great coverage but it does feel heavy on my face. I didn’t notice much oxidation but I did feel like I have cake face.

I am a neutral and it is hard for me to find the right neutral shade without looking a bit gray. Fenty gives this you this, your skin but better look. Somethings to note: 1. Shake the bottle well. 2. Put product on the back of your hand and then dot on your face. Usually it takes three pumps to reach optimal coverage. For me, one pump for each half of face and then one pump for my more discolored areas. 3. Product oxidizes slightly. For me, the shade looked too light and then turned into my natural color. 3. Use the pictures at FentyBeauty.com to gauge what your shade is and then get color matched. If you live far, look at YouTube to find ladies that where your usual foundations. Fenty is my new favorite!",1,7,65,100
64,itsjay,Brown,Black,Medium,Normal,Dullness,240,"I’m usually a MAC Studio Fix NC30 (or NC35 in summer). So, I researched online and people said that the shade closest to NC35 is the 240 shade, BUT if you are like me and in between he NC30 to NC35, I would definitely go for the lighter shade. People aren’t lying in these reviews when they say that this stuff oxidizes and has a very yellow base. Def opt for the more lighter/neutral color! That being said, I’m going to try the 220 shade and I will update my review when I see if that shade matches better. 1 star off for how yellow it is and because this stuff really does dry super quick. Which means my usual routine of just using my fingers to glide it around my face won’t give me the same seamless application I’m used to. I’m going to try another shade and try the Fenty brush for application, will update later! xox",1,4,37,80

70,jnn01,Green,Blonde,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,100,I am LIVING for this foundation. I am a foundation junkie that has tried and will try ever foundation that comes out and this one is the only one that has truly blown me away. It's an exact match for my skin tone and did not oxidize or go darker on me. It goes on beautifully and sets real fast to a matte finish but it's not cakey. It lasts me 10 hours with no touch ups needed. I have combo skin for reference.,1,4,36,100
71,lovelyleviosa,Brown,Black,Olive,Combination,Acne,310,"I have mixed feelings about this foundation. Positive attributes I’ve found are that it is very long lasting and very matte, which is something some people might not prefer, but I like how the matte coverage deals with my combination skin. Negative attributes are that it dries VERY quickly, so I have to pump it directly on my face instead of my hand, and it looks cakey in photos (I usually don’t put a lot). A mistake that I had with this product is that I used the color IQ I got during the summer and bought that shade in the winter, so it’s darker than me and I have to blend it into my collarbone area so it doesn’t look totally off. I would buy a lighter shade if I had the money to do so, but I don’t so I’m dealing with this until it matches me again. Overall, it’s a good product, but it isn’t that great.",1,3,27,80
72,adaoha,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Acne,430,"This foundation is THE best foundation I have personally ever tried! I initially got matched to 420, mistake. That made me not like the foundation as I felt it was turning up ashy on me. I returned it and decided to go the next shade up (430) which, unfortunately for me was out of stock for the LONGEST TIME! But I am so happy I did not give up on watching it. When it came back in stock I went to pick it up at a Sephora near me the next morning. I have oily/combination skin, more towards the oily side and this foundation lasts me a good 7-8 hours before I need to blot or touch up. This is my new go to foundation! To me, it's a very natural, light to medium coverage which is exactly what I like. And I feel it (somewhat) blurs my pores to a nice air brushed finish. It's a comfortable matte too, not too dry. I would highly recommend for people who love a natural touch for everyday use.",1,5,45,100

It was very lightweight, and didn't feel like I had anything on when I tried it. It dries down matte, but it still looks and feels very much like skin, which I like. It does dry down fast so you have to blend quickly, but if you work in sections you should be fine. I also really appreciate the wide shade range, both for me (I have kinda weird undertones and I have a hard time finding foundations that match my skin tone), and for all the girls I saw who were at the darker and lighter ends of the spectrum and were able to find a match. I love this product and everything it represents.",1,1,9,100

It is buildable, but dries so quickly that I wouldn't recommend trying to build too much, it may cake a bit. Drying quickly makes it a good partner for powder contouring and blush. My only complaint really, is it's longevity. Even with a primer, powder, and setting spray, this foundation doesn't look great for a full work day. By evening my skin looks dull and tired and my uneven skin is peeking through. I can (and do) refresh with a spray toner, but the coverage is still gone.

I have some acne every once in a while, have a fair amount of scarring and large pores. To say the least, I have imperfect skin. I've tried many different foundations high end and drugstore. I was at sephora with a friend and we decided to both buy this foundation and give it a try. I wasn't expecting anything amazing but let me tell you, this is AMAZING. It blends out really nice and looks natural on the skin, providing medium coverage and conceals discoloration. All I do with concealer is touch up acne and do my under eyes. With this my pores are not accentuated, it looks like a second skin, it doesn't feel tacky on the skin. After blending, it feels like a powder finish, which I love. Tackiness bothers me.

It dries pretty quickly and feels so natural and skin-like once its' on. You get great coverage, but it does not feel heavy at all.

83,CrisciAnaaa,Brown,Brunette,Dark,Oily,Acne,420,"GUYS WHO DONT LIKE THIS FOUNDATION, PLEASE READ!! I hated this foundation the first few times I tried it... Creases, emphasizes texture, dried too fast, hard to blend, not smoothing and little coverage but i learned how to use it. After watching the Fenty makeup artist tutorials , I realized that they don't try and ""Blend"" this foundation in.. They kind of just paint it on and let it dry after which is why this formula dries fast and is watery. This foundation needs to be SHAKEN UP LIKE CRAZY before you use it, me not doing this causeD separation and little pigment. Also this foundation does NOT NEED TO BE BLENDED, SPONGED OR BUFFED IN. I literally bought the Fenty brush after to apply and understand why they made that brush to go with it because I hate those flat foundation brushes; but this one is different and amazing with the foundation. I literally just heavily swipe on the foundation i over the skin and bam, that's it. I use about 4 pumps. It doesn't needed blended because it doesn't streak up like a more silicony foundation with with a flat brush. It just needs to be paint on like your painting a wall. After I started applying it like that the texture and creasing issue disappeared . My skin looks so flawless after I use it. It still doesn't have blurring properties for my forehead but it smooths over pores really well. Now also why I wanted to keep trying with this foundation is because the finish... I like More full coverage but the way this foundation is COMPLETELY MATTE with no gross cakey powder finish , the skin looks so fresh and almost glowy but none of those glitter particles, it's amazing. It looks soooo good in pictures and in person which is hard to come by. Get the Fenty 110 brush!!!! You will love it!!! Use a sponge or a buffing brush and it could give you problems... Or you could just swipe on the foundation with a regular dense brush but blending it will cause problems. Also make sure your skin is REALLY MOISTURIZED!",1,10,85,80

I tried with a mattifying primer, without a primer, with only a pore-filling primer, and without a pore-filling primer. BUT!!! I figured it out. I moisturized my face with Bobbi Brown’s Vitamin Enriched Face Base. I sprayed rose water all over my face. Then, I used Tarte’s Poreless Mattifying Primer on my T-Zone. FLAWLESS.

The only problem and main problem is that: it is very drying. I have used a primer and multiple different moisturizers, yet I am still left with patches of dry skin when using this foundation.

The shadows are a bit hard to find since the foundation oxidizes about 2 shades although with first application it'll seem more than hard to find a right shade. After the foundation sets it'll dark and take a skin like color and finish. I would suggest to get at least 2-3 samples from the store before purchasing. I sampled 4 shades before I found my perfect match. Initially when just by looking at swatches I thought I was 150 but after it oxidized I realized I was 120.

My skin did not like this; it made me look nearly 10 years older, accentuating lines and made my skin look dry AF. My skin has never looked this bad with a foundation. So, so disappointed.

95,Nezzaa,Brown,Brunette,Tan,Dry,Acne,240,"This foundation is really beautiful. I've used it in conjunction with the pro filter primer. This foundation dries into a demi matte finish (not too drying) and looks flawless on the skin. Many matte foundations emphasize my texture and other flaws, but this just sits on the skin beautifully and never settles or gets crusty. It has medium coverage but is buildable. The shade is perfect as well, which is the first time this has happened! even in other brands with many shade ranges, i have never found a foundation that matches both my color and preferred formula. For reference, I have combination skin with hyper pigmentation and mild acne. This does have a scent to it which lingered a while after application, but it didn't break me out so i will gladly continue to use this. WARNING: this oxidizes. its a must to use a shade lighter. I don't mind since it doesn't continue to oxidize all day, once it sets to the shade it will oxidize to it will stay that way. i recommend grabbing a sample of a couple shades and seeing which shade oxidizes to match you best.

My skin has to be hydrated and exfoliated for this foundation to work, and I have to apply it with a beauty blender a little at a time. It dries very fast and if you apply too much the color and the finish do not work at all. It also does not work well with all moisturizers and primers. I finally used Too Faced Hangover Primer and Neutrogena oil free moisturizer sensitive skin underneath and that worked well. I have not found a moisturizer with sunscreen yet that will work underneath it (recommendations?). When I nail the application of this foundation, it is beautiful and does not transfer to anything. I have deep acne scarring and a lot of texture so it really takes a lot of effort to nail the application but the matte nature of the foundation really does minimize this if I take my time and apply with beauty blender. When I tried applying this foundation with a brush and with a lot of product, it was a disaster. I almost gave up, but I am glad I didn't. This foundation really works great when I don't want to feel like I have a lot of product on my face and photographs really great. I am going to keep this foundation, but I don't think I have found my holy grail foundation yet.",1,2,16,80

It goes on and it's basically already blended. No need to set either, it sets itself. I've worn it for about three days solid now and it doesn't move or wear off.

After being super soaked and I finally realized to check my makeup everything was still there! I used the Fenty primer with it as well! I definitely would agree that if you’re someone who’s a bit more on the dryer side you definitely have to make sure that you moisturize your skin if you want to try this. Even if you want to try this foundation just make sure you prep your skin correctly prior to! But thank you Fenty for creating such an amazing foundation!!!

106,LadyPerle,Brown,Black,Medium,Normal,Acne,260,"I bought this foundation on September 8th when it first came out and for a week I got to test this foundation out.This past Sunday when I was in a dance studio. As a hobby I dance socially and the places I go get packed fairly quickly.I usually get about 3-4 hours worth of dancing in the most. With that being said it wasn't long before I worked up a sweat. When I took a break to cool off and pat my face down from sweat, several ladies complained about their makeup coming off. Let me tell you this foundation did not budge along with my other makeup on my face. I suggested to those ladies that were complaining to check this foundation out, it definitely lives up to its claim of being sweatproof, long-wearing, etc. I have gotten so many compliments wearing this foundation from strangers while being out and about. They said I was I have really nice skin. This truly does melt into the skin and looks natural. It doesn't feel heavy on the skin and I have not had any breakouts. As far as the shade range goes, one needs to go in person to swatch and test the foundation because they do oxidize. With Sephora's return policy it makes it easier to exchange and return the product. At first I was colored match with 290 and 300 which were way too dark on me. It looked like I was on the tanning bed. There are 40 shades in every color, it's insane so people are bound to find a shade that suits them. All in all, I am very impressed with the foundation that Rihanna came out with. I also believe that all those other celebrities need to pay attention to Rihanna's example and follow her lead.

I love natural looking makeup. I put this foundation on and it's literally like my skin. You will not feel it and it looks soooo natural. I have also NEVER been able to find a foundation that is my skin tone, it literally matches my skin perfectly. I would suggest not using an oily moisturizer before you put this on because eventually it will show through and if it does you can alway use a translucent power to touch up throughout the day. I would suggest trying the primer she has with the line. I think the foundation is the best thing in the line. I never do reviews but I have to give props where it's due. Another tip I have is to put it on with a stippling brush first and then go in with a Beauty blender.",1,55,429,100

121,tclewis91,Brown,Brunette,Olive,Combination,Acne,250,"Natural Makeup/Foundation Look. I'm multi-racial (Asian and Italian) and always have trouble finding a foundation that matches my skin tone. They are either too red (in which I look like an escaped oompa loompa) or too yellow (in which I look jaundiced). Finding the right shade: I went in store to find my shade ; one of the workers used the shade finder, and I was matched with 270. We then tried 240,250,260, and 270. If I had just shopped online, I would have matched myself with 260 or 270. However, I didn't consider the oxidization factor. You have to blend the foundation in and give it 30 seconds- 1 minute to darken. Highly highly recommend visiting the store and getting it swatched against your skin. Who is this for: There are 40 shades that cover a majority of skin tones. So, you'll most likely find one that fits you. Oily and normal skin gals, this would be a great fit. It keeps you matte all day without looking like a mummy. The product layers phenomenally. If you prefer a TM, just mix this with your regular moisturizer and layer it from there. If you prefer heavier coverage, use a sponge to layer it; it has build-able coverage and can cover acne and hyperpigmentation. It also feels lighter than most TMs/foundations. Who This Doesn't Work For: Gals with a lot of skin texture. If you have any acne scarring (not discoloration, but uneven skin like ice pick and rolling scars), proceed with caution. At the very least, you'll need a good primer. It doesn't necessarily emphasize texture, but it doesn't hide it either. When the rest of your skin looks pretty solid, the scars stick out a little more. Also, this might not be a great fit for dry skinned gals because it's matte and does a decent job of curbing oil. Misc: works better with the fenty blender than brush. The brush absorbs more product and doesn't have as much of a natural/photo-shopped finish. Also, it's not a true matte--think slightly more matte than Nars Sheer Glow with a similar texture.",1,3,23,100

With primer and a sponge/brush it looks effortless and ""real."" And ""real"" looking makeup will always be my personal preference. I AM SO HAPPY WITH THIS!!! FOR MY DARK GIRLS: If you have red undertones and are picky about the foundation you put on your face, try this line!!! The undertones are perfect imo. Not too orange-y and not too neutral.

I tried application with a brush, a damp sponge, and my fingers. The sponge gave the best results for me, but still ended up looking patchy. The patchiness just gets worse as the foundation oxidizes. The coverage is great. It is buildable to nearly full, but without looking dull or flat. If you have normal to oily skin and love the soft matte finish, I could see this being your HG foundation.

It is comparable to my all time favourite NARS foundation. The only difference i noticed was the finish of the foundations, NARS being more luminous than Fenty Beauty. The price point is amazing for a foundation thats being compared to a $60 one and because they are so similar this might actually replace nars for me. The coverage is pretty full in my opinion. I have acne scars that usually peak through most foundations and this one covers very well without looking heavy on my skin.

I hear the argument that you have to moisturize a lot, and use primer to make this foundation work. Well, I always moisturize and use primers, and still this foundation felt dry. For reference I am 49 and have combination skin. This foundation accentuated my wrinkles (made them look dry) and gave me a couple of zits on my forehead (some foundations do that to me).

I got matched for Fenty in the Sephora store and picked up a sample later on, then another sample, then eventually, a full bottle. This foundation really grew on me as I tried (and mostly returned) a LOT of different higher-end foundations over the last few months. The color match (150) is spot on for me-- closer than many other brands can get, probably because there are so many shades of Fenty to choose from. The finish is gorgeous-- closer to a demi matte than a flat matte. With the correct mix of primers, this stuff really glides on and perfects fine lines and the look of large pores (I use Fenty primer everywhere, with a dab of a pore-filling primer on the apples of my cheeks). Builds well to full coverage and if you want to set oily spots with a very light hand, it takes well to that. I'm oily and the foundation still stays in place all day. I will say that if you have dry texture, you might find this formula to be a little clingy, because it does take extra work to smoothly cover my occasional dry spot.

Pros: SUPER lightweight. It doesn’t even feel like you’re wearing foundation. I always feel foundation on my face and end up getting a major headache within a couple hours of wearing it but not with Fenty, which is super impressive. The color (180) is an exact match (first time ever!). I’m Asian and most foundation I’ve ran into haven’t had the right undertone or would be too dark or too light. Never a true match. However I can swatch a line of fenty foundation across my face and it’s blends right in. When I was testing it I asked my mom if the color was right and she asked where I put it, she couldn’t even see that it was on my face. CONS: Extremely matte, drying. I’ve tried three different moisturizers so far and no luck. I’ve even tried different primers. I also have the Fenty primer which is great btw but doesn’t work as a combination on my skin :(. I feel like this foundation really clings on to anything on your face. It sets into the lines under my eyes and creases on my nostrils. I have oily skin and it still dries me out. I’ve been reading review and review trying to find what can make this product work for me. I have problematic skin and with it being so dry it almost looks crusty. And I wear no powder on my face whatsoever. Overall, if your skin works with this foundation I think it’s great. There’s so many colors so if other lines don’t have your color, maybe Fenty will be your right match. I understand everyone has different skin and some things won’t work for me. However, I’m not giving up just yet because I love the color so much that I feel like I need it to work lol",1,21,153,60

Oh but I didn't give up on RiRi; I returned the 390 for a 420 neutral and a B**ch is BACK. Trial and error. There is a match for you too!",1,36,262,100
142,mmmmarie,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,140,When I fist put this foundation I didn't like it. My skin almost looked super dry (my skin is normal). After it being on my skin for a bit I couldn't stop looking at myself. My skin looked super healthy and flawless. Don't know what happened there lol. It's a buildable medium- full coverage. The shade range is excellent and the color I got couldn't have been a better match.,1,9,65,100
143,Hans1997,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,230,"I love this Foundation already, its only drawback is that it has a tendency to oxidize a shade darker. If you're an NC30 in MAC, 230 was a perfect match for me as it oxidized. The coverage is nice and build-able from low medium to full coverage. It feels extremely lightweight and airy on the skin. I personally do not enjoy Matte finishes but this one felt like skin and had not broken down on my oily areas nor had it clung to my dry patches.",1,28,202,100

145,Raquelms610,Hazel,Brunette,Tan,Dry,Dark circles,300,"Two stars because I like the coverage and the shade 300 matches me perfectly. It is very hard to work with though as it dries so quickly. Also it gave my skin a lot of texture and was flaky looking. The last time I used this it broke me out all over my face. Looking into the ingredients, dimethicone is the 2nd ingredient on here, along with talc, which are huge pore cloggers. I won't be repurchasing",0,16,115,40
146,DCmakeupGeek,Brown,Black,Ebony,Oily,Acne,430,"Wow, Rihanna hit it out the park!! I've never seen such a large shade range. She truly thought about every skin tone when designing her foundation line. She's accomplished something that so many well established cosmetic companies have failed to achieve. It feels so good to finally find a shade that matches my skin. Plus, it looks like skin. It doesn't look like a mask, nor feel like one. It's very light. I actually look forward to doing my makeup in the morning! She's a phenomenal musical artist and now cosmetic designer. Thanks Rihanna!",1,11,79,100
147,Ray92,Brown,Brunette,Olive,Dry,Dark circles,160,"I bought into the hype and purchased a full sized bottle of this without even sampling it first (which I personally NEVER do! Usually get a sample of everything before I buy), but I'm not disappointed with it at all. The color is PERFECT once is dries down, and I love the natural looking finish of it. Now, that being said, it is a matte finish foundation, and I do have skin that tends to be on the drier side, so I have noticed that I have to do a little more work prep-wise with this than with other foundations I've used. I have to make sure my skin is exfoliated and well moisterized, and I use a primer underneath, as well as a setting spray after, but so long as I do those things, it looks amazing. I do have my fingers crossed that she'll come out with a more dewy finish foundation in the future, but until then, I will use and love this one!",1,19,136,80

I wanted to love this sooooo soooo bad!!! that I gave it more than one try but it just didn’t do it for me. It applies so beautifully and feels like nothing’s there but after an hour my skin got oily and the foundation started breaking and all of a sudden I had patches of missing makeup on my skin. I wore it to work and I was looking like a greasy mess that I was so embarrassed to even be looked at. The first morning after applying this foundation my skin was so clean and smooth and after getting home i suddenly had at least 3 whiteheads!!!! and not to mention It oxides like crazy so I had to try on 3 different shades just to get my perfect match.

I have acne prone oily skin with some scarring. I was SHOOK when I put it on because it looks like skin! It is definitely medium to full coverage! And when it says it blurs your pores IT MEANS IT!!! I am so amazed and proud of what Rihanna has created! I will definitely be repurchasing this and more!!",1,11,78,100
150,yoya747,Brown,Black,Medium,Combination,Uneven skin tones,240,"I was so shocked by this! Rihanna has made me fall in LOVE with her foundation. Shade selection was super easy. Such an amazing range. This was borderline too light when I applied it but it melted into my skin so well and got a tinyyyyy bit darker about an hour into it. So it matched perfectly. I'm an NC25/30 in MAC. Gave a soft matte look! I say ""soft"" because it seemed to blur and made my skin look matte but not semi matte. Medium buildable coverage. Lasted the whole night of sweating on a Saturday night. I'm so sooooo in LOVE!! How did she do it???? I'm so picky and hate matte foundations and tried so many at Sephora and the drugstore. My skin in dry so it's hard to find one that sinks in with a good moisturizer. Give this a try. Honestly think it's Sephoras BEST foundation!

152,DHap,Blue,Blonde,Light,Oily,Acne,170,"After hearing everyone rave about this, I had to try it immediately! I went to Sephora and got a sample last night, and wore it all day today. The shade definitely oxidized a bit, so I think I should have gotten a slightly lighter sample. As far as application goes, it dries down VERY quickly. I only use matte foundation and this one definitely dries faster than any I've ever used, which made it a little tricky to apply. The wear was pretty good but I don't feel like it blurred my pores like everyone says it does and I still had to blot my face every 3-4 hours like I usually do. I still prefer my L'Oréal pro matte foundation, which is my holy grail.",0,12,85,60
153,emily13peanut,Hazel,Brunette,Medium,Combination,Blackheads,210,Great for the first hour. Oxidizes and turns 2 shades darker than when applied. Makes any peach fuzz and pores very prominant on your face. Oily texture doesn't keep shiny skin matte for long.. kinda unimpressed,0,13,92,40

157,Jpr1022,Blue,Red,Light,Oily,Acne,120,"I will preface this review by stating that I REALLY wanted to like this foundation. I've tried wearing this for a week with various different brushes, techniques, and primers in the hopes of manipulating this foundation to lay well. I normally have pretty oily skin with no previous issues with pores/texture. I also use high end skincare daily. This foundation is EXTREMELY drying and clings to any imperfection/texture you may have, creating a spotlight on those areas. Product is super matte, not soft matte, and you have to work quickly, section by section, because it dries down so quickly. It also makes any concealer you put over top of it nearly impossible to blend. Without fail, this foundation would consistently separate on my nose and mouth area. This has to be one of the worst foundations I have ever used. However, I feel like this is either one of those things where you will either really love it or hate it. I can only foresee this working well on incredibly oily skin. The shade range is a win, however, the formula is not.",0,1,7,20
158,Lambchop0827,Brown,Black,Medium,Dry,Acne,220,"Do not get it if you have dry skin with a lot of textures and dry patches. Unless you're willing to spend a long time prepping and stack on layers of moisturizer before putting it on, everything you want to cover with show on top of this foundation. I would rather spend an extra $5-$10 on another one that i know will work effortlessly. Don't get it because you want to follow the hype. know your skin type and what it can handles. Would've gave a 1 star based on my personal experience but gotta give props to Rihanna for the shades range and honestly if i didn't live in New England where it's freezing for almost half a year, leaving my skin super dry and flakey, this foundation might just be perfect for me. But that's not the case so unfortunately, it will have to go back. Overall, i would only recommend this for girls with oily skin.",1,1,7,60

163,sabrinaplx,Blue,Blonde,Fair,Dry,Acne,130,I have normal to dry skin and I was really sacred to try this out because of the matte finish but I'm so glad I did! It looks like my skin but better and doesn't dry my face out like I thought it would ! You do need to prep your skin frist and put a good hydrating primer before if you're on the dry side but the end result is just really perfect! The coverage is really buildable and I usually only use 1 pump (maybe 2 some times) and it really does the job and cover all my redness. I really recommend it and I'm so happy to see such a large color range Rihanna really did a good job with this foundation!,1,3,21,100
164,harleywhiz,Brown,Blonde,Fair,Dry,Dark circles,120,"First of all, I recommend this only to people with normal to oily skin, not dry skin. I was happy to find a match since I’m very fair, but applying this foundation was really hard to do. It dries almost instantly, making it hard to buff and easy to cake on. I also noticed that the foundation would wear away on parts of my face and seem patchy. Even with the primer and more moisturizer, I couldn’t get this foundation to work on my dry skin. The positives of this product was that it almost completely hides redness, photographs really well, and feels lightweight on my skin. I plan to return it since I have tried it 4 times with the same results. Maybe Rihanna will release a hydrating formula for dry skin in the future - I would love to try that.",1,1,7,40

I love it! First, it has always been difficult to match my skin tone without mixing two colors, shade 190 matched perfect! Second, a little goes a long way, be careful not to use too much or it does look cakey, I had to wash my face and start over because I used too much the first time. Second I have super oily skin, a blessing and a curse, this foundation has a matte finish which did stand up to my oily skin for a few hours, but once the sheen came through it didn’t make the foundation look worse. It did the opposite, it looked better! By the end of the work day it still looked fantastic, I went out to dinner after work and by the time I got home, to my amazement it was still in place and looked pretty darn good. Needless to say I went back to my local store and bought a bottle.",1,2,14,100

168,OGdaelynn,Brown,Black,Olive,Combination,Aging,370,"This foundation is tricky...you have to work quickly or in one area at a time because it dries down quickly. Also it does oxidize and took me two different colors before finding the third that worked for me. But it wears nicely and stays matte. But on me only for about 3-4 hours; I have combo skin. It did settle in my smile lines too. I think that may be avoided if I were to use less in that area. Lastly, upon building the coverage in certain areas I did notice that the color changed more.

Boy was I wrong. If there's one mistake I made in my life, it's not letting my skin be blessed by Rihanna's miracle potion right here. Medium, buildable coverage? check. Conceals acne, redness and blemishes? check. Doesn't clog pores? check. Keeps skin matte ALL DAY LONG? check. Seriously. I can wear this foundation from 6am, and not have to worry about blotting powder until 4 or 5 in the afternoon, which is something I have never experienced, seeing as my genetic lottery gave me acne-prone, excessively oily skin which cannot be tamed with any array of moisturizers, masks or primers.

I would suggest getting a shade or two lighter as it will oxidize to your desired color even if it looks really light upon initial application. I asked for samples in shades 180 and 190 just to test them out in the sunlight and while they are both very similar, 190 suits me better. I have a light medium complexion with a warm undertone and if it helps to make a selection for this foundation, I will list some of the shades I wear in other brands. MAC=NC30; Too Faced Born This Way=Warm beige; Lancôme Teint Idol=320; mostly ""medium"" in other brands. The formula for this foundation is long lasting.

After going to the VIB Rouge event and having the colors swatched on me, the foundation oxidized within a couple of minutes being applied to my face and made either look too dark or too orange also due to the undertones of the color. My perfect shade was actually 380 (for reference I am MAC NC45, Lancome liquid foundation 460, bareminerals chai 26). The formula is awesome and provided great buildable coverage.

But anyway I tried it today for the first time did my make up around 12pm and set it with fenty beauty invisimatte blotting powder(another holy grail i freaking love it) and I DIDNT NOT HAVE TOUCH UP OR POWDER MY NOSE OR T-ZONE ALL DAY!!!

Beware of the dry down...I was lucky in that I swatched three shades in store and was able to match from there, but they do seem to darken a bit from what the color looks like in the bottle. Pretty happy with the wear time too. Applied at 7am and was still looking good at 5:30 pm. Overall, super happy with the product and will continue to throw my money at this company",1,4,27,100

When I got back to my apartment I cried from exhaustion and then fell asleep. All throughout this, my foundation STAYED PUT! I’ve never been so in love with a formula, and I’m a foundation junkie.

The variation of shades is outstanding, and it’s just so airbrushed looking! Very impressed by fenty’s New foundation! I only gave if four stars because on dry skin, it cracks a little and sets into fine lines. So use a good pore minimizing primer first! Or one that is very moisturizer!",1,10,67,80
187,aliciaym,Brown,Black,Fair,Oily,Sensitivity,130,"When this foundation initially came out, I was extremely hesitant to try it since it was Fenty Beauty’s 1st launch. Rihanna is such an icon and her makeup is always flawless, so I knew deep down her products would be nothing short of amazing. Purchasing it felt a bit like I was included in a monumental event in the beauty community. Coming straight out of the gate with 40 shades is something that has never been done, and you can tell there are so many other brands are now riding off of Rihanna’s coat tail. I always have a hard time finding a foundation that will match me, since I am extremely fair with yellow/golden undertones. Most foundation that are light enough for me, are either a neutral or a pink. I have rosacea and acne, so finding something that is full coverage is the only option in my opinion. The shade itself is perfect since my face has a pink hue to it from discoloration, but my neck and chest pull very yellow so it’s a perfect match. I pair it with the Fenty pro filter primer, which creates a matte long wear combination of my dreams. If you are looking for a foundation that has a full coverage, but doesn’t cake up during the day or feel heavy. Look no further than the Fenty foundation!",1,3,20,100

I look f*** ridiculous (in a great way) like I was in the bathroom lookin at myself and I started bumpin rihannas needed me song and I grabbed a hairbrush and I was like feelin myself, like I KNOW im a bad bi*** kinda way. But for reals literally this foundation is like god sent. My girlfriend was like dang gurl what you wearin and I was like girl it’s Rihanna’s sh** and she’s like I ain’t even surprised and then she went to go get it, like that’s how good it is, you’ll feel like you HAVE to get it like you itching for it it, you become like a crack addict but like with foundation. If any of y’all put a low rating then go watch some YouTube videos ans learn how to apply makeup cause this stuff is f*** A1 like for reals for reals.",1,20,132,100

195,scfosneca,Hazel,Brunette,Fair,Combination,Aging,190,"So I think I might be in love!!!!! Probably the only foundation I've tried that actually stays on my oily face!!! Beautiful coverage without looking cakey! I'm really surprised on how long it lasted on my skin, usually with other foundations my skin starts to get oily within the first hour. I wore this for seven hours and I had barely any shine when I washed it off! Truly impressed by this product!!",1,7,46,100
196,Samanthabee13,Hazel,Brunette,Light,Oily,Sensitivity,150,"Ookkkkaay this foundation is absolutely EVERYTHING. This is big for me to say I have returned all of my foundations for the past year and have just been wearing face powder. I could never find anything that was up to par with my skin and my expectations. I have oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin and it changes constantly. I have never tried a full coverage foundation because they never looked right and felt very heavy. But thisssss OMG it looks like real skin, its not heavy, matches my face perfectly, and has not broken me out. Usually when I try a foundation the first couple of days my face goes nuts so I know this is good. ALSO it stays on for the whole day for me! im shooken and rihanna blew my mind with this I hope she creates more!",1,8,52,100
197,Joeyyyy,Brown,Black,Deep,Combination,Acne,390,This foundation is amazing ! when the Sephora worker matched me I was so excited that I didn't need to mix 2 colors together to get my tone. It was my exact shade and the price is just right!,1,8,52,100
198,mamacoumba,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Acne,420,"This foundation is very natural. For those who want a natural and very light finish, this os for you. Unfortunately it does not work for me. I have textured skin with a lot of hyperpigmentation and it doesn't cover all of it. I tried to use color corrector with it but still it doesn't have that full coverage effect. I also noticed that it looked very orange when I applied it which is not good for me. I'm so bummed I really wanted to like it and support what she was doing. Maybe the next launch.",0,2,13,40
199,michaael,Blue,Brunette,Porcelain,Normal,Acne,110,"i'm shook omg, i have never had a foundation look this good all day it goes on beautiful and leaves your skin looking so smooth, i don't need a filter!!!!",1,6,39,100
200,MadyHasan,Brown,Brunette,Medium,Combination,Acne,130,"Let me start off by saying that I love Fenty. But this foundation did not cut it. My skin has a few dark marks and some texture, but it's not noticeable with a little concealer or drugstore foundation. While the shade of this product was spot on (I rarely find anything yellow enough) the coverage was TERRIBLE. I tried this multiple times, with a brush, sponge, Fenty primer, Benefit Porefessional, no primer, with and without moisturizer, and NOTHING saved the look. My texture was emphasized, it took 6 pumps to cover my fading acne scars, and I was oily after 3 hours of being inside an air-conditioned building. Not my cup of tea, but if you're looking for a little skin perfector and you already have amazing skin, go for it. Maybe it'll work for you.",0,2,13,40
201,cantypop,Brown,Brunette,Dark,Combination,Acne,400,"This foundation is bomb. Listen. I have tried Mac, Lancome, Dior, etc. This is the only foundation that doesn't leave me looking like a grease ball dipped in sheen. My sensitive skin that hates everything love this product. I used the primer in this line along with two applications of this foundation. I only used two applications because I didn't get the concealer in this line and needed to cover up some old acne scars. This foundation wears like skin. It's doesn't crack, fill into lines or crevices, or round over bumps. It's make your skin look beautiful. Go to Sephora and get matched. There are so many beautiful shades. You really want to find the right one for you. I am a NC50 and matched perfectly with 400. Also, I wore this foundation for 6 hours without having to retouch or blot. This also didn't break me out or take a million washes to come off. Love it! Please run to Sephora and get a sample.",1,12,78,100
202,Mscammiek,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Sensitivity,450,"So, the first time I got matched by a sephora rep, she swatched my cheek, let it dry down and i bought it. I should've known better because I have hyperpigmentation around my mouth and also neat mt jawline. The center of my face is lighter than my neck and chest. The foundation came out ashy all over when I put a full face on (420). I went back and tried 450 all over. It's not PERFECT match but it covers everything. If there was a warm shade between 440 and 450, that would be me but I can definitely get away with it by doing a little highlighting. Overall, it literally covers everything , didnt need to prime or set OR conceal. Mind you, I have combination oily skin and my forehead gets especially shiny. I have some hyperpigmentation like I said but I don't have many blemishes and my skin doesn't have a lot of texture so I don't know how it pans out on other types aside from reviews. It applies well with both beauty blender and the fenty foundation brush which I use for highlighting as well. It dries down fast so work in small sections and build to the coverage you want. Most of the darker shades (My shade and beyond) are pretty red which is the only real issue since not every dark skin black girl has red undertones. I definitely recommend going into the store and testing out shades for yourself before purchase OR find a YouTube beauty blogger with your shade/tone skin and watch them review. You'd get a decent idea from that as well. So just a takeaway, YES worth the money, DON'T need primer, YES it is buildable YES feels skin like, and YES it literally looks like you used a filter for your face!",1,13,84,80
203,Crombono,Brown,Brunette,Medium,Oily,Acne,230,"I am in love with this foundation! A little goes a long way (especially when applied with a damp BeautyBlender), and it goes on so smoothly. I have oily skin and this foundation has really held up to the test. Most other ""oily skin"" foundations I've tried have left my skin feeling dry/tight or ends up looking creased, but this one feels like I'm not even wearing makeup. It's a super matte finish which is exactly what I was looking for. I can't stand when I look shiny. I think I finally found ""MY"" foundation.",1,18,116,100
204,ileanabear,Brown,Brunette,Fair,Combination,Blackheads,120,"I have combo skin (leaning on the dry side) so I was sure this foundation wouldn't suit me at all but its actually not bad at all. After 14 hours it started to oxidize but that's pretty good compared to other foundations, and the coverage is awesome. You just have to make sure you shake the bottle a LOT, apply it with a beauty sponge, and wear a hydrating primer (I used her Pro Filt'r Instant Retouch Primer and its the perfect companion). I think this would be an awesome foundation for someone with oily skin",1,16,103,80
205,Eye Color Brown,Brown,Black,Deep,Combination,Acne,370,"It took me a long time to actually and purchase this foundation. It look me FOREVER to find my match. At one point I was convinced there wasn’t a shade for me lol buuutttt I found it, finally. When the foundations first launched I was convinced that 390 was going to be my shade based on swatches and the models used. I got a sample of 390 from Sephora and tried it out. When I applied it, it looked a little orange but figured after highlighting and setting it it would be my shade. I was right. Kind of lol as the day went on, the foundation got even more orange and it was not flattering at allll. I looked like an oompalompa lol. So, I went back to sephora a few months later and swatched 370 which was a little too light. That’s when I gave up, I wanted to believe in the hype but I couldn’t. After a while I said “F*** it” and bought 370 online and hoped for the best. The foundation did exactly as I predicted, got a little darker after application and after highlighting and countouring, the foundation looked like my actual skin. I didn’t even set the foundation because it looked so matte and perfect on its own and still lasted all day. While also covering up my acne scars and discoloration. If you have dry skin I don’t think it would be the best option unless you moisturize and hydrate your skin very well before hand. But the hype is beyond real, I’m so happy I didn’t give up lol",1,7,45,100
206,Aphernai,Green,Blonde,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,100,"I have been using this foundation for a couple of days now and I can happily say that I like it. I love that a new line released 40 shades, I wish more brands would take note. A little bit of product goes a long way, and I like using a brush to get the coverage I need. I think it does a great job evening out the skin and has a gorgeous finish. I like that it is lightweight and is matte, but still has a natural look to it. I think this will work for a lot of people and skin types and skin colors. This is how a foundation line should be. Also it comes with a pump, with a decent amount of product!",1,5,32,100
207,ayekh,Hazel,Brunette,Medium,Combination,Acne,180,Shade 180 is a perfect exact match if you wear Estee Lauder Doublewear in Sand. It has a similar matte finish and dries fast while providing great coverage. Does not darken when it dries and did not make me oily despite the heat and sun. I'm buying!!!,1,5,32,100
208,arieljean,Blue,Blonde,Light,Combination,Acne,160,"I want to like this foundation so badly, but I have not had success with it yet. What I do love about the foundation is how incredibly it matches my skin tone. The color is beautiful and looks just like my skin tone. However, the product just sits in my pores and fine lines and does not blend out well on drier areas. I cannot put this stuff under my eyes, no way! I have larger pores around my nose and this foundation unfortunately just sits in them making them look bigger and more noticeable. I am going to give it a few more tries though because I want to experiment with applying it in different ways. So far I've only used my foundation brush by It Cosmetics, but I want to try blending with a sponge or maybe the Fenty foundation brush. Is the brush worth the hype? How have people been applying this foundation?",0,17,108,60
209,BEYOUtifulgrin,Brown,Brunette,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,100,"I really wanted to like this foundation. The lightest shade actually matched me and I was so excited to try it! Unfortunately, after about 6 hours of wear you could visibly see cracks on my face from the foundation. This surprised me because I have very oily skin! I so wanted to fall in love with this foundation, but it didn't work for me. Props to Ri for having a shade light enough to match me though! It's worth trying out, I suggest getting a sample if you can before you buy.",0,3,19,20
210,sarbot,Blue,Red,Porcelain,Dry,Acne,110,"I'm super impressed by this product so far. First of all, the shade match is incredible. I'm pale with pinky-neutral undertones and shade 100 was TOO PALE for me! (I'm typically 0.5 UD Naked or 2Y05 MUFE) I ended up with 110 and I love it! The wear was really nice during the day and it didn't really oxidize on me. My skin is normal to dry and every foundation tends to be a bit wonky on my nose and forehead. This was no different, but I can work with that because the colour match is still wowing me.",1,12,76,100
211,alexlunamarie,Brown,Blonde,Light,Combination,Acne,120,"I love this foundation, but it isn't the most intuitive product to apply. So I wanted to drop some tips! 1. Use a *moisturizing* primer! Because the foundation is so matte, a super dry primer will cause the makeup to not sit right on your face. 2. Apply in sections. This formula dries FAST, so apply one section at a time and blend quickly! 3. A little goes a long way! 2-3 pumps should cover your entire face. Don't get too much, or you might look cakey! Try these tips if you want to really enjoy Fenty foundation.",1,9,57,100
212,sephoragirl511,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,430,"Legit the best liquid foundation I've ever used. I have normal to combo/oily skin and it's perfection. If you skip everything else in the line, fine. But don't skip this! I see this working on dry skin as well with the right primer. I got the shade 430 & it's my perfect exact shade! And match yourself don't rely on the artists in your store! Bring your own foundation brush or sponge like I did and go to work!",1,16,101,100
213,fblissful,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,420,What can I say about this product is its amazing. The color actually matches me and I don't grey cast or orangey look that I get from some foundations. I love the look and feel of it.,1,13,82,100

It not only goes on so smooth, but it warms up just a little and has great coverage without making my face look fake. I immediately bought it! Also, afterward I went to work and this foundation stayed on all 8 hours of my shift and my skin did not appear oily when I went to remove it.",1,7,44,100
216,CandyMadeUp,Green,Auburn,Tan,Combination,Acne,420,"I was a little skeptical at first, thinking it was all a bunch of hype. It seems that no one ever gets foundation right for African American women...until... So my husband has NO filter when it comes to a poorly made up face. As the Sephora associate applied the foundation I held my breathe, waiting for his unsolicited instant review. He saw my face before I did. His immediate response was, ""FINALLY!"" Then I saw what he saw...an awesome foundation on my face. The foundation is so lightweight and easy to apply. Very little product is needed. I am completely sold on it. I suggest using the Fenty primer with the foundation. It lasted a complete 12 hours and a full schedule. I love it!",1,7,44,100
217,Roxie08005,Brown,Black,Dark,Dry,Sensitivity,410,"I really like this product and love the amount of research Rihanna and her team put into it. My thoughts: 1. I highly recommend getting the primer to go with it if you have any texture or large pores on your face. 2. If you have dry skin like myself, definitely moisturize! It can be a bit drying since it is a matte finish. Your dry patches will show up. 3. Less is definitely more when it comes to this foundation. You only need a few pumps. I wouldn't try to build it up to full coverage. It's definitely more of a light to medium coverage. If you need more coverage use a brush instead of a sponge. 4. If you have a lot of acne scarring and imperfections this may not be for you. Like I said it's more of a light to medium foundation. Building it up to full coverage makes it look Cakey.",1,49,308,100
218,mrssassy,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,430,The foundation was a good match for me. It is long wearing and kept my oily skin under control. I like that it's light weight. I suggest getting a sample of at least 2-3 shades before you decide what color is best. I can go between 430 and 440 and in the winter I may need 420. I had 440 and returned it and I got 430. As a reference I wear NW44/45 in MAC and the Too faced peaches and cream foundation is a good match for my complexion.,1,12,75,100

Once I put it on, my makeup was flawless, perfect color match, nice blend, and it looked to smooth. 30 minutes later it oxidizes and turned darker and pinker.

I was originally matched a wrong color by the Sephora girls but I went to a different Sephora store and they were finally able to match me to the right color. I mean it happens, it is what it is. Buuuuut let me tell you this foundation is everything and it's so worth it! I have oily skin but during the winter I have dry patches so you absolutely must hydrate your skin before applying and use a good primer. And I believe the brush you use to apply this foundation either makes it look FAB or it won't blend well. I use Morphe's G9 foundation brush to apply this and it makes the total difference! However, do apply and blend quickly because it dries fast. I wore it to a hot sweaty club and it stayed looking flawless, I didn't even have to touch up with my powder. I definitely recommend but do make sure you are matched the right color because it does oxidize.",1,8,49,100
226,serenafcrain,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Acne,430,"*claps hands* Girl!!! You need this in your life! Rihanna did that! I have always been a girl that sticks to foundation when it comes to make-up. I don't know much about highlighters or contours, but I know what a good foundation looks and feels like on my skin. This foundation is great! Pros: -I have oily/combination skin that usually causes some of my make-up to slick off by 5pm. I used this with Laura Mercier Translucent Powder and my look lasted from morning to evening! -It's buildable. I like that the consistency is light and a bit watery, so I could start with a little and build as needed. -It covered my hyper-pigmentation and dark spots beautifully -It helped me learn that I have some undertones in my skin -The range of darker shades. It's phenomenal. Cons: I LOVE that this started with 40 shades, but all of the darker shades are sold-out online and in a lot of stores. Thankfully I ran out the day of and bought a few bottles. I guess this speaks more to the demand that women with darker-complexions have.",1,28,171,100
227,LanaSolas,Blue,Red,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,100,Here are my thoughts- Pros- Nice Matte Coverage Makes My Face Feel Soft The Color Range is Great! The Bottle is Aesthetically Pleasing Cons- If you are sensitive to smell this is not for you. I suggest trying a sample first and seeing if it bothers you. After a few days I couldn't stand the smell and had to return it. This does not work with dry or combination skin it will get patchy. I had to use a hydrating primer from Laura Mercier to get it to stay put. LAST THOUGHTS - Its a great product and I do recommend it. Although if you are looking for something with full coverage I suggest trying a different foundation. I love Rihanna and her Fenty collection and tried to make it work but the smell ultimately got to me. This foundation is great for a more natural look that will basically stay on your face all day after using the right primer for your skin type.,1,1,6,60
228,PepperMay,Hazel,ns Damage,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,100,"This line offers many shades and makes it super easy to get a perfect color match! Tbh the formula wasn't my favorite. I really wanted to love this foundation because it feels super light weight on the skin and offers decent coverage. Unfortunately, I have very oily/combination skin and this separates terribly on my more oily areas within 2 hours of me wearing it. With my experience with this product and while working with it on clients today, I feel like it works best if you have a dry/normal skin type. It is water based so it does perform better with a waters based primer. I would definitely wear it again to give it another try but it isn't a holy grail and it isn't a favorite either.",1,3,18,60

I went into Sephora looking for a foundation and had their make up artist sit me down and try a bunch. I've been using kat von d's lock it foundation for 2 years prior but wanted to see what else was out there. I tried about 5 foundations and this one blew me away. It perfectly matched my skin but the thing that blew me away the most was hows natural and air brushed it looked. air brushed is the best way to describe this foundation. honestly I wear it everyday now and if i touch my skin it doesn't feel like foundation on my skin, it feels like skin on skin. if you are looking to try a foundation consider this one, it's a life changer",1,4,24,100

231,Cocoavisage,Brown,Black,Ebony,Oily,Unknown,470,"For years, I had to be a 'mix-master'. I was mixing at least 3 different foundation shades to create a perfect match for my skin tone. Being very oily, and a girl that sweats on her face doesn't help matters much either. I was spending lots of money on multiple bottles of expensive mattifying and waterproof/resistant foundations (which tbh not many are truly sweatproof). So when I saw the shade selection for this line and that it literally said ""sweatproof"" I was on it. I tried it and I get SO many compliments on my skin, not my makeup, MY SKIN. It makes my skin look flawless and doesn't break apart where I sweat! One thing to note, it oxidizes so to get your actual shade match you need to swatch it on your face and wait a few minutes to check the resulting shade.

I start of fine but then I turn orange. Yesterday I mixed a bit of Tarte’s CC cream in medium with the foundation. It’s lighter than my skin tone so I didn’t look to orange by the end of the day.

A friend had shade 190 and it was too dark/warm for me so I thought I’d go up a couple shades and it would be perfect. Finally after lots of thought of whether I should buy it without finding my right shade, I bought shade 170 of the foundation and also the primer... and it is the best foundation I’ve ever put on my skin!!!! I have sensitive skin, with redness all over, usually I have dry cheeks And an oily T zone so majority combination skin, so I was kinda holding back on purchasing this because of people saying it looks terrible on dry skin. But I was glad I didn’t listen because it works amazing!!! My pores disappear, my redness disappears, and it is super light on the skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth!! It definitely dries to a matte finish quick so make sure you blend it quickly. One con would be it transfers a little bit but other than that I wouldn’t trade it for the world because of how flawless it leaves my skin!!

It oxidizes pretty bad and it leaves the most unflattering texture on your face. There were parts of my face that I did not even know I had texture on, that had the texture emphasized because of this foundation. All the other foundations I own do not emphasize texture, it is only this one. I would only recommend this if you have flawless skin or no texture at all.

However I have dry skin and I like my foundation to be dewy and glowy, not matte. If she comes out with a pro filter foundation that is dewy I'll be the first in line to purchase. However this foundation fell flat (literally) for me. Great color but it looked dull due to it being matte. I suppose this is great if you have oily skin but I would have loved to see a dewy counterpart to this foundation. I recommend only if you have oily skin.",1,3,18,60

I had the wrong color because of my undertones. Anyway the foundation feels smooth, isn’t drying as long as you use the primer with it and looks gorgeous on your skin! Also I love the packaging",1,5,30,100
246,Stephlynch,Hazel,Blonde,Fair,Combination,Acne,120,I was so excited for this product but it makes my face so dry and it sinks in and magnified everything and made my face look terrible.

I am gonna have to back and get something with more of a warm undertone because my neck is more yellow lol. Other than that? I LOOOOOVE! Ladies if you can? Please go get this asap! I normally only do kat Von d but this one? Is my other new favorite. I love full coverage this one is medium coverage but definitely build-able and doesn't give you the caked up feel. I love it! Rihanna did great.,1,1,6,100
248,Trulee,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,210,"Great foundation! It's light weight, doesn't cake up but... it oxidizes darker, so get a shade 1 to 2 shades lighter! It's not a flat matte which is good and it doesn't look powdery (like some matte foundations look)",1,6,36,80

I’ve never had a foundation that matched my skin so perfectly that I don’t bring it down my neck or put it on my ears, and it’s STILL seamless! I’m super oily, and I use this foundation with the Fenty primer, and it keeps me matte longer than any other foundation I’ve tried. It’s definitely worth the money! And a little goes a long way!

251,RinnC,Brown,Black,Medium,Combination,Acne,140,"This is so far the best foundation I ever used. I have acne prone skin and foundations usually break out on me at the end of the day. Not with this one! Fenty foundation gives a mid to full coverage and has a very slightest scent to it. Just a tiny bit of product goes a long way. This foundation gives a natural looking and matte finish. When first apply the product on, it might be a bit of “white” ish, however give it a couple minutes to sink into your skin then you’ll get the best looking skin ever! For people who have dry skin, I recommend moisturize a lot before putting the foundation on as this could be a bit drying. I put a couple drops of Josie Maran Argan oil and mix it with the primer before putting this foundation on and my skin would look flawless until the end of the day! Also, use the Fenty foundation brush and sponge with it, together they work wonders! This is the love of my life!!!",1,1,6,100

254,Jabby2012,Green,Blonde,Light,Combination,Acne,190,"I think Pro Filt'r Matte is one of the better foundations to be release in a long time. The coverage is medium to full depending on how much you apply and I never need to use a setting powder over top as the dry down is soft and almost powdery. The immediate look is soft matte with very even coverage. I've also use the foundation with a concealer brush to cover acne and discolourations and it's very effective at covering up like a concealer, basically a two in one product. The product drys very quickly so you have to work fast. If you apply to one area at a time, you really have to blend your edges. Once the foundation has dried down, it's basically stuck in place, no moving it around with a damp beauty blender. The foundation oxidizes quite a bit. I was left with a hint of orange coloured skin, especially in oiler areas like my forehead and T-zone after a few hrs wear. This product isn't great for aging skin (I'm 44). I found that the foundation settled under my eyes and emphasized fine lines and wrinkles. Definitely not a good product for people with dry/very dry skin. The product sticks to dry skin and again, emphasis the issue instead of covering it. I've tried mixing 1-2 drop of facial oil into the foundation which helped with pliability but unfortunately the product still oxidized and settled into lines/wrinkles. I would recommend this product and encourage readers to try it as it's an excellent foundation. My hope is that Fenty releases a companion foundation with a more hydrating formula for drier, aging skin types.",1,2,12,60

My makeup was still on, practically all intact, and matched my skin tone perfectly! Coverage was great, very buildable but I didn't have to use much (pump and a half) in order to get a good even medium coverage. I did use the primer which may cause a difference but I didn't use any sort of setting spray or powder. (I'm extremely lazy with my makeup and can do it in 15 minutes or less) I highly recommend to anyone who's busy all day and doesn't want to do touch-ups!",1,3,18,100

It's matte but not so matte that you look 2-dimensional. I have normal/combo skin, where depending on the week i have an oily t-zone and dry cheeks. As long as I moisturize my dry areas REALLY well (with a highly hydrating cream like PTR Cloud Cream) this foundation glides on like a dream. It lasts about 8 hours on my skin before it starts to break up. One major con: there is serious flashback with this foundation, so beware of taking photos.",1,3,18,100

259,solaris905,Hazel,Brunette,Light,Dry,Aging,150,"Unfortunately, this foundation did not work for me. It was hard to blend, as it dried extremely fast. It felt and looked very powdery on my skin, and exaggerated every pore, line and dry patch on my face, even with Fenty Beauty primer underneath. It also just kind of sat on my face in little clumps. The color match itself was good and I did not experience any oxidation. It seems that it would be better for younger, oilier skin types. I feel like the entire line is geared to people under 30, as it offers a lot of glittery products which generally do not flatter older skin types. Too bad.",0,15,89,20
260,Ldoro,Brown,Brunette,Dark,Oily,Acne,410,"I have this foundation in 410. I originally bought 420, but it was too orange. I have dark skin with golden undertones. You really must go in store to match. It is going to be extremely difficult to pick a color from online swatches. I really like this foundation. I'm amazed at how matte it is and remains throughout the day. I am oily and after 4 hours of wear, I still don't need to blot. It's the first foundation that makes me think I can get away without setting it with powder (I do, of course!). The very thin formula makes it very lightweight and capable of building up to fuller coverage and still look like skin. It will cling to dry patches so you may want to avoid if you have dry skin, or be sure to moisturize and prime with hydrating primer before application. And finally, I can't not mention the fact that Rihanna released 40 shades! Incredible and unheard of. Brava, Rihanna! I've worn this foundation for two days straight since purchasing it and both days I received compliments from people who have seen me many times previously. I will definitely be adding to my stable of foundations.",1,7,41,80

264,EmeraldDreams,Brown,Black,Deep,Combination,Acne,360,"I tried the foundation in a sample, and I was so surprised about how much I loved this foundation! I didn't expect much from this foundation as I usually don't have much luck. I have combination skin with my chin, forehead, and cheek area by the nose being the most oily. I expected the foundation to slide and to be worn out by the end of the day. HOWEVER, this foundation surpassed all of my concerns! First, this foundation matches my skintone in a way that no foundation has matched before. It blends perfectly into my neck, and it is incredibly lightweight and buildable. Second, It kept my oily areas tame with me only having to blot throughout half of the day. And when I did blot, the foundation still looked nice and sleek and not patchy. I am in love with this foundation. I normally use the cult-favorite Double Wear by Estee-Lauder, but I honestly believe this one is way better in that it is more long lasting, light, true to my skintone, and more gentle on my dry areas.",1,4,23,100

Imagine my shock (and argument with the woman in the store) after this foundation in 450 oxidized on my skin. Perfect match! I wore it that night to dinner, and then out dancing the next day and my face still looked great when I got home. I’m a greasy girl, so we’ll see how this hold up with my 10 hour work days (from 6am to 6pm). I bought the trio in the store, and just ordered the primer today. I’m all FENTY now!",1,4,23,100

I have extremely pale combination skin with dry patches and this stuff applied like a dream. It didn't have any flakiness and was buildable without looking cakey. I applied it at 11am and got home around 6:30, and it still looks just as perfect as when I first put it on, without any primer or setting powder/spray. It even stayed matte in the 30 degree weather, but the best part of this foundation was the incredible shade range. I always have had trouble finding my foundation colour with brands at sephora, but this matched me perfectly and I'm sure girls at the darker end of the spectrum will love the shade selection just as much.",1,6,34,100

Regardless of what primer I use (or even don't use), regardless of what setting spray I use (or don't use), regardless of what powder I use (or even don't use any...) this stuff refuses to stay on my face. The longest I have been able to keep it on my face is about 4 hours. I am not dry, I am not oily. I don't know what the problem is. I have tried sponges, I have tried fingers, I have tried brushes. I think it's strange that I apply it before 6am and by 10am it looks like I haven't put any makeup on my face and the most I've done is sit at a keyboard and type! It takes everything on top with it.

I was so stoked to try it because I have excessively oily skin and everyone was saying how matte this made them. The first day I tried it, I was disgustingly oily within an hour. AN HOUR! I thought maybe it was due to the fact it was the day after I used DE's BabyFacial with the oil afterwards, so I gave it another shot. On the 2nd day, I used a moisturizer that I use on a daily basis and AGAIN, beyond acceptable oil within an hour. I have to blot my face 5 times a day to control it since I've been using this foundation. This isn't normal! I can't be the only one experiencing this.

I've tried everything under the sun for a perfect colour but nothing ever worked (cover fx came closest but do not like texture of their foundations). I've tried Armani, Charlotte tilsbury, YSL, Estee Lauder, Maybelline, ubran decay and nothing is as good as this for a match for my pale skin. The texture of it I wasnt in love with but matte and dry just do not go together. Butttt I have found a way to make it work. I prep my skin very well before I put this on. Moisture, then cover fx illuminating primer, mix the foundation with an oil I used smashbox primer oil then I use the Beauty blender to apply it.

I am crazy for this foundation, it's a game changer for my look. Rihanna really knows her foundation, and she knows how to create colors that are real, that real women have.

Any other brand makes their pale shades with pink undertones or their warm undertones that actually make your skin look orange. So I give it two stars due to that and the great coverage this foundation gives you. I really wanted to love this foundation, but it settles into wrinkles and pores. It also gives your skin a scaley/flakey look. I have tried so many different ways to apply the makeup but it always turns out like that.

As for the product itself-- if you have dry skin, I really do not think you will like this foundation. I used it with the Fenty Beauty primer and I still felt it drying on my combination skin. However, it looks beautiful on the skin when it is first applied. It made my skin look so soft and flawless. But after about 4 or 5 hours, my skin started to look oily. I definitely recommend carrying oil blotting papers with you. As for the oxidation, I really didn't see it. Most of the shades tend to be more on the yellow/gold side, but they don't oxidize that severely.",0,5,27,60

Two pumps and I have full full coverage, and the most lightweight texture I have ever felt. It dries down perfectly, but doesn't dry my skin. It's got just the right amount of shine to it but definitely doesn't look oily. I'm a Sephora employee and have applied this to 50 people today and it look so geogeous on every skin tone, type, age, you name it, everyone has been so impressed and happy with it. This will be my go to foundation and for $34? Really cannot beat it. Cannot recommend this enough!!",1,5,27,100

It's very lightweight, but the coverage is very nice without being cakey. It feels like you don't have anything on, it makes your skin really smooth, and it's also long lasting! It is comparable to the Makeup Forver HD foundation but this one is humidty resistant and a lot cheaper. My MUF shade is Y315 and I bought the 200 in this foundation.

I actually liked the coverage(light -medium) and it had a gorgeous soft matte finish. It felt really lightweight on the skin. At the end of the day I felt that it looked a tad bit patchy, but nothing a little powder couldn’t fix. Unfortunately after using this for a week, my ENTIRE FACE is broken out. I am so shocked because I have not had a product break me out like this in at least 5 years. I️ will admit that I have sensitive skin, which the product description says this foundation is suitable for. I would have to disagree.",0,13,70,40

The foundation was fine for a few hours, but around hour 7, it started to feel like my face was dirty, and all my pores were clogged. The foundation also started to make my face oily, and made my skin look darker than it was in the morning. I do walk around in the city a lot, but I have tried other foundations (bare minerals, sephora, even Loreal), and none of them have made me feel like my face couldn't breathe by the end of the day. I paired this foundation with my all-nighter urban decay setting spray the second day, which helped control the oxidation of the foundation, but I still felt like my face was super oily by the end of the day and my skin felt clogged. This foundation seems to work for so many people, and the range of colors is truly amazing, but for me it just didn't work.",0,3,16,40

I’ve tried everything from $10 foundations all the way up to $200 foundations and they don’t even compare to this! The only thing is that you need to make sure you wear moisturizer underneath if you have dry skin bc it clings to dry patches and it dries really fast so you have to put it on in sections. Other than that, perfect foundation, perfect skin match, feels like my skin. Doesn’t feel heavy...LOVE IT",1,3,16,100

I was shade matched in store and it is literally so spot on that I don't even need to blend down my neck. This is definitely a medium coverage foundation, and I personally don't think it's buildable- after adding a certain amount the foundation just won't blend very well and there's no increase in coverage. It's a definitely a demi-matte as well; I personally have a super oily t zone and I need to put on powder after this foundation, but that's also normal. In general it's really great quality, but it also dries super fast, so you have to blend really quickly. I would recommend this to a friend for sure, but for me personally I think that I'll have to keep looking for my ""holy grail' foundation- although I'm glad I made a stop here along the way!",1,3,16,80
308,andreiittaaa,Brown,Brunette,Light,Oily,Blackheads,200,I LOVE IT ALREADY! I decided to go in store and do the color iq (I forgot my number ugh) and it wanted to match me to 230 so the employee swatched it on me but it was too orange. We tried a couple swatched and it came down to 210( which was my gut instinct) and 200. 200 ended up being a PERFECT MATCH FOR MY SKIN I WAS SHOCKED! I think since it’s winter and my skin is naturally lighter and since the product does oxidize a little 200 was the match! So definitely get matched in stores and go a shade lighter. I hate foundation because my skin is super oily and I sweat A LOT but this is the best foundation I have ever tried. Can’t wait to purchase it once the sample runs out!!!

324,tkvas,Blue,Brunette,Fair,Combination,Acne,120,"Literally the most incredible product I have ever tried. I have been constantly looking for the perfect foundation. I have tried lancome, este lauder, dior, the list goes on. If it's popular, I have tried it. None of them worked for me, and none of them were as long wearing as Fenty. To test this foundation, I put it on at 7:30am, worked and had class until 4, went to the gym for two hours and sweated vigorously until 6pm, and this foundation had not even moved. It looked just as good as it did when I first put it on. I am very fair, and this is finally one that matches me and it's a blessing. However, this foundation does oxidize, so keep that in mind when picking a shade. I was matched in the store as 150 and it looked perfect, but I also got a sample of 120. 120 seemed so light and I thought it would look terrible. However, after the 120 dried down it matched me perfectly, and the 150 was a touch too dark. I read that you should pick a shade two shades lighter than what you think your color would be which proved to be true for me. Despite oxidization, this is hands-down the best foundation on the market in my opinion and it's also affordable. I am in love and I don't think i'll ever try another foundation again.",1,7,36,100
325,veasleyk,Brown,ns Damage,Dark,Oily,Acne,420,"I am able to wear both shade 410 (natural skin color) and 420 (brighter skin color). I love almost everything about this foundation from the application, color range, price, smell, and initial finish. However, I wish this had stronger mattifying power. I have oily skin and within about 4.5-5.5 hrs my skin had a medium amount of shine focused around the T-zone and chin. However, I feel that the oiliness can be overcome by using more of the magnifying powder and blotting paper. I left the foundation on for about 9.5-10 hrs, added blotting powder once around 5.5 hrs in and blotted with paper about 6.5 hrs in and the foundation was still intact perfectly. Even though this lacks in oil controlling I believe this is a good everyday foundation even for oily skin especially since I'm used to wearing Lancome Teint Idol ($50, shade 470 suede c), but be prepared to have to do some oil control. Also this is a liquid foundation that dries quickly so I wouldn't recommend applying via dots all over face but rather apply in sections.",1,29,149,60

I had a few people say they didnt even realize I was wearing foundation..which is great because I want a flawless natural look. Also, the color matched perfectly (thanks Sephora color IQ!) There are a few things people should know about this though. 1.This product is perfumed. It has a scent, and it will linger a little bit (this is why I took off a star, just a personal preference for scent-less cosmetics). 2. It dries very quickly, and can be a little difficult to wash off. The good news though is that it really lasts throughout the day!",1,8,41,80

It is buildable but it won't cover under eye circles at all for those who have bad circles. 2nd is the wear throughout the day, this does not stay on at all; 4 hours after wearing (with the too faced hangover primer) the foundation moved around in my face and looked quite splotchy and even a little orangy. I bought it because it made my face look soft and smooth when I first tried it on at Sephora, but when I took it home and wore it for a few days it just wasn't worth the hype to me.. it's not a HORRIBLE product, just not personally worth it to me.

355,MoAlana,Brown,Black,Tan,Combination,Unknown,310,"I just picked this foundation up yesterday and had a chance to wear it all day today 8am to 8pm. Let me first start by saying I am very impressed! I will leave lots of detail below for those of you who are interested :) I have combination skin, I am oily around my nose and slightly outward toward my cheeks but normal everywhere else. I applied color 310 over a primed face with a flat top kabuki since a brush was suggested over a beauty blender for fuller coverage. With one pump the foundation applied as a medium coverage, with 2 pumps the foundation was a medium to full coverage. It applies smoothly and is extremely comfortable on the skin, it moved with my skin did not crease at all during the 12 hours of wear and did not feel heavy or cakey at any point. I did not have to blot my face (nose/cheeks) until about 2pm and also used a translucent powder to set that area afterwards. I could've used another blot around 6pm, but chose not to just knowing that I would be taking it off within the next 2hours. Although I had to blot because my oils were coming through, the foundation itself did not slide around or break apart in those areas which is incredible and something I don't encounter very often. I will say that if you are looking for the type of instant full coverage that you would find with a foundation like Estée Lauder Double Wear, I do not think this is as full coverage of a formula initially. However, most foundations can be built up to that desired intensity and I can see that this one could easily be built to completely full coverage with 3-4 pumps. In summary: At this price point I would highly recommend this foundation I think it wears beautifully and it is an outstanding value especially considering you get slightly more than the standard 1oz of product. A huge congratulations to Rihanna for developing and launching such a stellar product! This foundation has exceeded my expectations and I'm excited to try more of the Fenty line!",1,1,5,100

This, however, is the PERFECT shade for me. There's not a lot of brands who cater to both light and dark skin tones and it's amazing that Rhianna has done it. With most brands, the pale shades usually have neutral undertones and it makes it really hard to find a foundation that you don't have to mix in a concealer with just to get it to match. I have dry skin and this foundation slightly picks up on the dry patches on my nose but not on my cheeks or chin like others have. My nose has always been a problem with any foundation I've tried so I'm not taking away any stars for it because I'm sure if I upped my skin care game it'd be no problem.

392,sarahhbankss,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,100,"I was so excited for this foundation to be released that I went to my local Sephora the second it opened to test it out. I feel like products created by celebrities are either total hits or misses and this was ALMOST a perfect hit. The main pro is the color selection. I have a difficult time finding a color to match my undertone because I am very pink on my face, but my neck pulls more yellow. The neutral undertone blends perfectly. After color matching my biggest problem is foundation settling into the my laugh lines and the lines on my forehead and making them more pronounced. Not this one. I'm not sure if it's the fact that it's the matte formula (I normally use dewy finishes), but I've had this on for six hours now and my skin looks almost airbrushed - barely any settling whatsoever. It's also very lightweight. I was shocked that it felt like I had nothing on my face even going back in for more coverage. I just love the feel of it on my skin. But now for the cons... It is supposed to be medium coverage, but I would definitely call it light. The formula is water-based and VERY runny when it comes out of the pump. It look me going over it quite a few times to get the type of coverage I was expecting. It's unfortunate because now I'm predicting that I will go through the bottle more quickly than expected. The biggest flaw to me is how quickly it dries on my face. The sales associate explained to me that since it's water-based it needs about a minute to dry and set on my skin. This was NOT the case when I wore it tonight. I felt like I could not more fast enough to blend it out before it dried. I had stubborn splotches all over my forehead and jawline. I'm not sure if my application method was flawed because I'm used to using a more hydrating formula, but it was incredibly frustrating.

I do not believe it's full by any stretch of the imagination. It builds somewhat but I think it will lose some of its beauty if you attempt full coverage. I do not think it emphasizes dryness, fine lines, pores or any texture imo. It's the first foundation I've liked in a long time. I just can't be bothered if it emphasizes any of those things. I bought color 180 and it is a true golden undertone not a peachy warm. Right now I would estimate being an NC20 in Mac terms and 180 is great.

Swatched it on my hand & it felt AMAZING! So i had one of the girls test it on me to be color matched & OMG the way it felt on my skin was awesome! I bought the foundation, went home & removed all of my makeup & put this one on to give it a go & about 2 hours later it still looked hella good! I live in California where it's hot AF & i legit did not have to touch up. IMPRESSED & HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The variety of color range is a big plus as well!",1,8,35,100

427,MissAsp,Brown,Black,Deep,Oily,Acne,420,"This is not a perfect foundation, but it's the closest I've ever seen! It melts into my skin so well, and the finish is extremely natural. Pros: Shade range- I have dark Indian skin, and struggle to find something with the right undertone. This was practically perfect. My best friend is a mixture of French and Native American so she struggles to find light foundation shades with an olive undertone- she also found her perfect match. Price- My last ""almost perfect"" foundation was Marc Jacob's $70-ish full coverage foundation. This foundation looks way better on me, as the finish is more natural and the skin tone an almost exact match. Lightweight- I forget I'm wearing makeup Long-lasting- At the end of the day, it looks almost exactly the same, with no gross melting effect. It does NOT rub off onto other things- I say this as someone who doesn't use primer or setters or whatever on top of my foundation Cons: Shades oxidize- the foundation does end up a bit more orange after it dries than when it first goes on. Coverage- this is more of a medium coverage than full coverage. Of course, there are concealer sticks and primers you're meant to use with this, but I'm cheap and lazy. Overall: If it's tricky for you to find a foundation, because other companies think you're too pale/dark/olive/Indian/whatever, DO try Fenty. This will become your new fav. At $34 a bottle, this is amazing.",1,26,111,100

But boy oh boy was I let down, after a few hours it was streaky and patchy, and by lunch my nose chin and forehead was extremely shiny and broke apart. I applied the foundation correctly, sweeping and pressing not buffing and it still bunched up in places.",0,8,34,40

Finding a shade has always been hard for me but now I won't have to worry about that! The coverage is medium and does not over dry the skin but I do have to apply it quickly because it dries fast. No problem with that! I just work one side at a time. I love how it makes my skin look natural. Would definitely recommend.,1,4,17,100
430,Kaiyah,Green,Brunette,Light,Combination,Acne,110,"To be completely honest, I first purchased this product because of all of the hype. I then heard great things about it (like shade selection, formula, hours of wear time, etc.) but then I tried it and it’s safe to say I am more than disappointed. Although the shade is perfect for my pale skin, it dries incredibly fast, making it nearly impossible to blend. It also oxidizes. I find it breaks down after about two hours, which is definitely not worth the money. The formula is horrible for dry skin as it picks up on every patch, and it’s nearly impossible to build the coverage as the makeup doesn’t stay in place. Terrible as masking discolouration and imperfections as well. I definitely DO NOT recommend this product. I haven’t even used half the bottle and I’ve already purchased a new foundation.",0,4,17,20

And immnot getting oily and there's no separation. I'm going to try wearing it to a party and see how it handles sweat. I'd recommend because its skin like if you want a natural look but it's also buildable if you want a beat look. It dries fast which I love. Blend as you go and you'll love it. Again I'm just shocked this thing works so well on me so far. I found my perfect match too. Btw it didn't oxidize on me?! i guess everyone's skin is different? Nothing noticeable on me.,1,14,59,100
435,AnaBananAna,Brown,Black,Deep,Dry,Dullness,330,"For starters, it was amazing to walk into Sephora and see so many people of all nationalities hovering around the Fenty display. You could literally see a shade match for every women there looking for foundation. Amazing job, Rihanna! and other ""high end"" brands should take note! There's clearly a huge, under represented demographic!! Anyways, I'm a normal to dry skin type and I RUN away from anything matte. I moisturized and primed (Laura Mercier Radiant Primer) and applied this with a damp beauty blender and used a MUFE setting spray. This drys quickly so working in sections is imperative. It literally dries down to a natural, soft matte that looks like your skin. I'm so impressed! It didn't emphasize any of my dry patches or textured spots. So prepped skin is key for my dry people! 2 pumps gave me medium, flawless coverage. My freckles were toned downed, red spots concealed. This doesn't transfer and feels so lightweight that I completely forgot I had it on. And it lasted for the 8 hours that I had it on without fading. My sales rep was so helpful she picked 330 for me. At first I was like yeah right, it's too yellow! But after a few minutes it oxides and matched perfectly. For reference I'm Syracuse in Nars, Suntan/Maple in Laura Mercier and Nc42/44 in Mac. And all this time, I've never had the ""perfect"" shade match but 330 is it for me! Another plus, it's super affordable compared to other brands!

The Pro Filt'r Matte fit the bill exactly! Even though this is listed as a medium - full coverage foundation, I find it to lean more towards medium. I did not find that when applying more layers of this foundation that it added more coverage, but it also did not cake up which was great! Also, after applying a full face of makeup, my face did not feel heavy or congested with this foundation. Other matte foundations I have I can feel on my face, almost as if they're sitting on top of my skin like a mask, clogging my pores. Lastly, did I mention color match?! This matches my skin tone P E R F E C T L Y! It's almost scary how much of a match it is!

I have extremely oily skin, acne prone due to medications and always have an issue of foundations ""pooling"" up in the middle of my forehead and on either side of my nose. Seriously, it's terrible. This foundation is just as amazing as the Hourglass! It is so beautifully matte, applies easily with the Fenty brush (don't try a beauty blender/sponge, it doesn't work! I love my sponges, but happily switched to a brush for this amazing product) and doesn't move at all. About 7-8 hours into the wear I need to blot, but that's much longer than most foundations so no complaints from me! This product works very well with the Laura Mercier invisible loose setting powder. I also use the LM Blemishless Primer and this combination has been fantastic for me.

It dries really fast so I put it on in sections (with a damp sponge). it looked very natural on the skin and I set it very lightly.

449,KatherineLouise,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,180,"Please prep your skin before applying this. It has a LONG WEAR formula that you should search on the face and neck and then let it warm up to the skin for a few seconds and then blend part of it out to see the proper shade, because of the LONG WEAR formula it does tend to dry down darker. Do not prep the skin before trying the dry down. ALL skin types should be able to wear this IF YOU PREP YOUR SKIN. Don't put on a 34 dollar foundation and expect it to fix your skin. This is a medium to full coverage foundation it blends well with a sponge but the brush that she sells alongside it will give you the most fuller and smoother coverage. It dries down fast because it is meant to be that long wear matte but natural finish. Meaning, that it's going to dry down matte but will give the soft appearance of skin so it doesn't look dry. If you're dryer use a different hydrating primer the primer she has is not really helpful for dry skins since the foundation dries down matte. I still set with my laura mercier and it lasted my 7 hour shift and until I washed my face at 10pm. It's an Amazing foundation!

It applies very smooth with a beauty blender, although it dries much faster than I’d like. It also oxidizes quite a bit so I’d reccomend testing a shade lighter than your match.

At first it looked pretty good on my tzone and cheek area, but then it started to go down hill towards my chin (slight scarring and minimal texture). It accentuated fine lines and dry spots that I had never seen before, and this was with one thin layer applied with a damp beauty blender. I tried building it up but to me it only looked worse. Now the color... I actually went into a Sephora so I could match myself. I tried several shades and 120 seemed to be the closest match.

I was matched as 240, but I like wearing foundations just a hint darker to warm up my face. 250 was perfect! A little definitely goes a long way. I barely used 1 full pump and the coverage was amazing-- not completely full, but not too sheer. It was just right. Also wasn't too matte either. Love it!

478,GhostBee,Hazel,Brunette,Porcelain,Dry,Acne,100,"I REALLY wanted to like this product. I had seen some good reviews and when I color matched it in a store, it was PERFECT. However, the spot where I matched it on my face was the one spot on my forehead that is the smoothest, oiliest, and is also scar free. When I got home it had oxidized in the one spot, and became a bit to yellow, but that didn't bother me (I am very fair skinned and have patches that are more pinky and some that are definitely more yellow, so sometimes one undertone works better than the other). It was also a little warm in my car so I did sweat a bit on my forehead, so it seemed fairly moist looking at that time. When I got home, as I wanted to try how it wore thought the day, I cleaned, primed, and started to put the foundation on. It was a nightmare (probably felt worse because I really wanted to like this product). It dries too quickly, and becomes hard to blend after a few seconds (damp sponge, brush, and finger, all the same). As I tried to fix that, I noticed it accentuated all of my acne and chicken pox scars (I have some big pox scars on my cheek that don't cover easily). I finished the whole face, and I looked like a piece of white chalk that was next to a piece of yellow chalk, my skin looked and felt DRY. It was very hard to look at my face and feel good about it. I had a friend (going through cosmetology courses) come over, who also thought it looked bad, and she tried some things to see if she could get it to work, and if it didn't accentuate my pores, I looked to dry. Nothing worked, and I after it oxidized, it was to yellow or dark and no longer matched. My friend tried it, and it did work well for her, as she has normal/oily skin, but my color was too light (after oxidizing). For me, it was to dry for my skin, and the oxidizing was strange (maybe a miss batch bottle?). But my friend did get some and she loves it. But for really dry, and scarred skin, it was a sad miss.

I passed it off to a friend, though, and she is loving it.

It comes in so many shades- and finding the perfect shade has always been a fight for me. To my dismay I have had very dry skin this winter, so I make sure my face is properly moisturized (not oily!!) before and during the application of this product. A few notes- -This foundation is WATER BASED you need a water based primer to use along with it otherwise it can smear and set strangely in the pores causing a cakey look. Water and silicone don’t mix. -For the love of all makeup please please pleeeease (IMO) use a damp beauty blender to apply, especially if you are noticing it “drys too quickly before you can blend”. Not. Enough. Moisture. Your fault (sorry), not the brands. Don’t expect your fingers to give you an airbrush look. This foundation is considered Matte..so it does dry quickly...your fingers are not going to do the job for this one, and honestly should have been retired from your makeup routine years ago. (Again, this is my humble opinion- apologies if I have offended any of those who still apply makeup using their phalanges) -I successfully use this product by spraying my face with water (moisture) after my initial application, then drying (with any type of fan/flat object you can use without hurting yourself)- before applying any other layers of makeup (ie bronzer, contour, blush, highlight etc). - Take care of your skin. If you don’t have a decent, well-treated canvas to begin with, don’t expect to paint the Mona Lisa. End of story. - Never apply too much. This should go without saying, but due to some of these reviews. I feel I should say it again. It’s the same concept when painting. Never apply too much product. You can always apply more. What do you expect when that happens? A nice seamless application from your now globby mess? Honestly. Just no.",1,2,7,100

Definitely try it for yourself if you want to, see how it works, figure out how to use it, and if you like it, keep it. After all, makeup is an exploration. PROS: - awesome shade ranges and undertones -price point was reasonable -it did not break me out. I have combination skin and am also acne prone. it did not give me any pimples more so than usual. i have heard occurrences of it giving people pimples so it may just vary case by case. Though i will say, i have a pretty thorough routine of removing my makeup to ensure nothing is left on my face and no pores are clogged (First a general swipe with a makeup wipe, then an oil cleanse, and lastly face wash) and that is also a factor of how the foundation reacts with your skin. CONS. The main reason for docking of stars is because I feel like it did not fully accomplish its description. It claims to be for all skin types,resistant to sweat, not too matte, undetectable, and long wearing. The foundation began breaking apart midday. My t-zone was looking oily, but still in contact while my cheeks and everywhere else seemed to have gotten patchy. It felt too dry, very matte, and cakey since i did need to layer it up due to my blemishes. It was like the foundation was sitting on top of my skin. CONCLUSION: If someone only uses a layer, I could see how it might be lightweight and ""second skin"". That just was not reality for me and i think if it says you can build it up, it should be able to be done without it being cakey so that you can still have that ""light as air"" texture. There are also a lot of awesome advice out there for how to make this foundation work! However, if this product is marketed as a layer-able foundation that will last long for every skin type, I feel like you shouldn't have to be finding little hacks to make it happen.

522,judychicago,Brown,Black,Medium,Oily,Acne,180,"I'm an Asian woman of color with oily, acne-prone skin - this foundation is perfect for me. It has excellent coverage and lasts very well throughout the day, even in extreme conditions. I've worn this foundation to parties and concerts, and even through hours of sweating and dancing and singing, the foundation held up very well. I also find that due to its thin, watery consistency, it is very buildable for areas where I have acne scars, and doesn't bunch up awkwardly when you apply more layers. I would not say that a single layer (1-2 pumps with a beauty sponge) is full coverage, but you can definitely build up to it. Now, to address some concerns: this foundation does NOT oxidize. What it does is dry down matte, kind of like paint: a fresh, super wet layer is not what the final product will look like. My shade, 180, looks EXTREMELY stark on my face when I first apply, but dries down to a perfect match. I've heard that some dry skin folks like this, but I would caution anyone with active dry patches to steer clear. I occasionally get dry around my mouth, and once had a dry patch when I put this on. The foundation definitely clung to it, so I recommend moisturizing those areas very well before applying. My only major gripe with this is that it does crease a little in the lines around my mouth and nose (a problem I have with basically every foundation). I find that if I prime and powder well, I can go several hours without seeing creasing, which is impressive. Kudos to Rihanna for formulating such an excellent, long-lasting foundation that caters to women of all skin tones and races.",1,4,13,100

I probably swatched 5-10 before deciding on one after seeing how they oxidized (some stayed pretty true to color, some turned much darker and some were cartoonishly yellow) and combined with harsh fluorescent lighting that you'll find in every Sephora, finding your color could be a real challenge! Besides the color being wrong, it settled into any and every pore, line or crevice on my face and made these imperfections look even more pronounced even with the primer. The coverage was too sheer for my taste and didn't seem to apply very evenly and when I tried to layer a bit more and build up the coverage, it seemed to just wipe right off. I may exchange it if I find a better color match and see if it works out better after I play with it a bit, but it's more likely that I'll just return it.

I prepped my skin really good and the foundation looked nice. Except for where it rubbed off on my nose. This foundation made my skin extremely dry even after taking it off. I have drugstore foundations that work better than this. That's okay, because I know it's not for everyone.",0,9,25,20
587,ch1cgeek,Blue,Blonde,Light,Normal,Aging,120,"I popped into Sephora the day Fenty Beauty arrived in stores to ask for a sample of this foundation. I received two samples - 110 and 120 since I am very light with neutral to cool-toned skin. I love foundation. It's just, like, my thing. Some people love eyeshadow. Some people love highlighter. I just love foundations and creating a flawless base. And I really tried to love this foundation. Seriously. I tried it three different times, with three different primers, with three different applicators. The product dried so quickly that I couldn't use my damp beauty blender - it would just dry in the spots I dabbed it on, even while working in small sections. Using a brush was more effective, but I still found the formula to be very patchy and dry. Again, it dries very quickly so I would advise working in tiny sections, very quickly. It settled into my fine lines. Those pesky frown lines between my eyebrows were emphasized and surprisingly even my smile lines - which I have never had happen before, with any foundation. It also emphasized the texture on my cheeks. Not only that, but I found it very difficult to blend product on top of it (liquid highlighter, concealer). I put a small amount of concealer under my eyes as well as dot some between my brows, down my nose, on my cupid's bow, and on my chin. After I blended in my concealer with my damp beauty blender, I noticed that I could see exactly where I had applied all the little dots of concealer to my face, because they were there. It was the weirdest thing and is difficult to explain, but it wasn't a good look. I am really surprised to see so many positive reviews. The second time I tried it, knowing how drying it was, I slathered on some argan oil, let that sit, put on a thick moisturizer, let that sit, then put on a moisturizing primer, let that sit, and the results were still very drying, so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong... Maybe it is just a HG for oily girls.",0,4,11,20
588,MaddieXX,Green,Brunette,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,110,"To begin, I am beyond thrilled to find a foundation that actually matches my pale skin perfectly (110 is my shade). The formula is extremely liquidy and lightweight- it feels like nothing on my skin. For reference I have normal skin (no oils, no dryness) but I do have significant acne. This foundation does not oxidize on me or change colors (I've heard the paler shades do not but some of the darker shades do). I find this easy to apply, I dot the product all over my face then blend with a Beauty Blender. I do not find it to dry down so fast that I have to work in sections like some of the other reviews have said. One pump of the product gives me light coverage. Two pumps gives me medium coverage. I cannot get the coverage higher than that. I do have acne so I have to go in with a full coverage concealer on my spots in addition to the foundation. This product gives a soft matte finish, I don't find my skin dewy at all but it's not so matte that it looks flat and cakey. It looks like second skin on me, almost like a filter. I gave this product 4 stars because it claims to be a medium to full coverage foundation but I did not find that to be true- it's a light to medium coverage. However, despite that it looks beautiful, like second skin on me. I think this foundation is for someone who wants light to medium coverage, wants their skin to look natural like they're not wearing foundation, and wants a soft-matte finish that looks like a filter on the skin.

I went to 3 different Sephora stores to have different people give me a full face of this foundation. They all 3 picked shades pretty close to me..but the best shade match was 130. The color was great. It was very lightweight feeling. But the negative part is that it made my skin look beyond dry. It clung on to all of my dry spots on my face and accentuated any imperfection/blemishes on my face. The Sephora ladies even went as far as giving me a mini facial and cleaned my face then applied a nice hydrating moisturizer and then tried the foundation. With the same drying results. We even tried multiple different primers. Still nothing worked. 2 of the ladies thought it was just my skin and that they were sure other foundation did the same to my skin. I told them my current foundation I use. They applied it to my skin and were amazed at how much better it looked on my skin then the Fenty line. All 3 Sephora ladies told me it looked overly drying on my skin. So I returned the primer and foundation I purchased as this just didn't work for me. I sort of feel like girls are buying this mainly because of Rihanna and who she is. I really wanted to love this. But it just didn't work for me.,0,4,10,20

I'm usually skeptical of celebrity based makeup but this exceeded my expectations.

I tried it with the fenty primer and my Becca first light primer and neither looked that great. Will be returning for sure. (I got shade 120 if it doesn’t show up lol)",0,6,12,20
654,Afrykah,Brown,Black,Dark,Combination,Uneven skin tones,410,I can't get enough of this foundation. It looks and feels like skin. The amount of coverage and the finish I get from this product is perfect for my needs and it works well as an everyday foundation. This is my very first liquid foundation and I typically go for tinted moisturizer or powder foundation for everyday but this seems to dry to a powder like finish so it's right up my alley. I am not the full coverage type I love when my skin shines through and you cannot tell if I have anything on my face. My skin is normal with slightly oily T zone so the formula doesn't move around on me and it definitely is long lasting. The only thing difficult about this was finding my shade it took several sephora visits but I'm not complaining about it!,1,2,4,100

It does dry on to a dry patch I have next to my lips but I assume that’s normal? Other than that the box says this is median to full coverage and for my skin this isn’t just basic coverage. I’ve seen at tons of YouTube videos and I believe they just hype it up because this is Rihanna. If you want something basic but good maybe something you can wear to work and not feel so heavy on your face this is perfect for you then.

Easily buildable, but with a naturally sheer-medium finish (aka my skin looks flawless but I can still see beauty marks). I have naturally dry skin so I haven't had any problems with this product melting off my face (I do set it with Laura Mercier translucent setting powder). I even wore this product all night in 100 degree California desert heat at a wedding and it still looked perfect at the end of the night. My only issue is it does run a little thick, so cleaning my brush can be tough.

It aged my skin, made it look worse than if I just went without foundation. Primer. No Primer. It didn't make a difference. I finally after playing around with my skincare routine, waiting over an hour for everything to sink in good and applying only a thin layer of my sunscreen and mositurizer I got it to sit and look ""decent"". However, it won't stay. It transfers, slides off, disappears, I don't even know. I've set it with different powders and still the same. Its just garbage. And I hate to say that. I want to love this.

665,rohannag,Brown,Black,Ebony,Combination,Unknown,490,so i went into my sephora in jcp today and everything was in stock even the dark shades. at first i wasnt here for the line because it more focuses on skin and i love eyes and lips more. but fenty beauty has changed everything for me! ive never been excited about foundation until today because i match not only one shade but two shades! both 490 and 480 match me right now which is amazing because i have room to grow fpr the winter when i get lighter. i have never had this before and i can totally say i agree with cancelling everyone else who doesnt have my shade. it feels amazing to be included for once and actually look forward to applying my base. i cannot speak to the wear and functionality of the foundation yet as my order has not shipped yet (i ordered before visiting sephora) but looking at how matte it is on my sister today i can def say i like that. will update when i do wear mine though.,1,1,2,100

668,precious10129,Brown,Black,Dark,Normal,Dark circles,390,"This is my absolute color match. It's amazing that I do not have to mix two shades anymore. The only downside is the formula dries down to a concrete dry matte that exposes all your pores and smile lines. For a dewy finish, you must use a moisturizer underneath the foundation. Do not use a primer of any kind. I strongly advise you to use a pore minimizer as well. Other than that, this foundation is the bomb and I look forward to whats to come! Two other brands that are dead-on matches to Fenty #390 that too does not need shade mixing are Bare Minerals Hazelnut and Huda Beauty Cinnamon.",1,1,2,80

First, I find matte to be a little last season - dewy and luminous is in, imo. (And yes my fellow oil slicks - with the proper skin care you too can pull off the luminous skin with out looking like a grease pit trust me). I put this on and immediately looked like a corpse. The color match was great but it's so dry and thick. It dries down so fast and does NOT play well with other products! I felt like everything else I used after was dragging across my face. Not friendly to even the tiniest dry patch you may have! It broke up on my nose within hours using her primer. As much as I wanted to love it as I have combination skin, it wasn't for me. The price point is fantastic though and if she ever came out with a luminous foundation I'd totally give it a try!",0,1,2,40
670,Madgrooves,Green,Brunette,Light,Combination,Uneven skin tones,120,this product was so nasty looking on my skin.

I also get dry patches over healing acne so some foundations cling to those. But that's not the case with this foundation! I have finally found my holy grail. This foundation has amazing coverage, it's covers all of my active acne as well as my scars. I only use concealer on my under eye circles because it's not needed anywhere else. A little goes a long way! I wore it for 12 hours through a lot of sweating and I didn't get oily at all!! The foundation stayed in tact and in place and did not seperate. The shade is perfect, I didn't blend it down my neck the first day to test it and you couldn't even tell it matched me perfectly (I'm shade 150 but in the winter I'll probably drop to 140). My boyfriend said that my foundation looks like ""the girls who work at Sephora"" which is a huge compliment! It didn't cling to my dry areas, it smoothed out my pores and it lasts all day and looks flawless! Definitely a must buy and I will never switch foundations this is my holy grail!",1,1,2,100

But do NOT set it or the primer before hand, no matter how oily you are. I'm pretty shiny and even my T-zone looked scale-y and dry. It also made me breakout a good 2 hours in.

684,bakaLisa,Brown,Black,Medium,Combination,Acne,160,"I use the Fenty Beauty Primer before applying this foundation. Great coverage and long lasting. It DOES oxidize (I had to go from shade 230 to 160 when I realized how different the color of my face was compared to my neck within the day of wear). It does get a little cakey around the corners of my nose over time. I really wanted to love this product because of how flawless it made my skin look- but I came to realize that the Fenty line has been the cause of my breakouts. I do have acne prone skin, but I have never experienced this big of a break out that lasted for such a long period of time (it's been 4-5 months). I thought it was just hormonal and stress, but these breakouts has been non-stop since November 2017... and that's when I realized it was also around the time I started using Fenty. I probably should have noticed it sooner, but it was just a vicious cycle because I was ironically covering up my breakout with Fenty on days where I just couldn't bare the sight. I thought maybe it was my skin care routine and that I wasn't cleaning my face properly. I invested in a Clarisonic and stopped wearing makeup for awhile. My skin was finally showing progress of recovery, until I applied makeup again for a party. My face broke out again and I've come to a conclusion that the search for another foundation/primer continues :(",0,1,2,40
685,KelseyDk,Brown,Blonde,Porcelain,Dry,Aging,130,"Alright, please don't hurt me because I'm going to have to say that this foundation is just ok. The formula is very blah to me. There is some great pro's but also some strong cons too. Here we go... Pro's -the dry down is great! Zero tackiness; you almost don't need a powder -the Color selection.... obviously! This is the first time I've ever had a Color match that has been dead on. I'm quite fair with really strong yellow undertones, and the undertone has never seemed to be quite right in the past. -the bottle is nice to look at. -the coverage (both a pro/con for me) Con's - this dries hella fast!!! Work in small sections and pretend your Speedy Gonzolas! -I expected more coverage. I use the matching primer, and also bought the sponge and the brush. Now, I do enjoy the coverage, but for something that people claim to be full coverage, I don't find that to be the case. My freckles still show through. -this is not long wearing! Again, I use the matching primer, and tools from Fenty, but I really can't get this to last throughout the day. And my dry dry skin, tends to look a little shiny at the end of the day. In summary, is this my holy grail? Definitely not. There are just not enough things to enjoy to retire my vast foundation collection. But, that being said, I've never had this accurate of a color match, so that is something that I just can't shy away from. I will continue to use it, but will still experiment with other formulas.",1,2,4,60

I would definitely recommend the matte sticks that complements the foundation because the textures together is what really gets you that smooth overall look. The brush buffed everything out flawlessly and quick and that is something I love...I don't have time to blend all day.

I did this because the girl at sephora recommended a very hydrating skin prep. Even after doing this my skin looked dry and patchy, and the foundation didn't even hold in spots that my skin is perfectly normal. Even with two layers the foundation was light coverage at best. Granted I used a damp beauty blender but the brush application was making my skin look even worse and textured. Also it oxidized. From far away shots and in good lighting it looks okay but in up close shots you can see it definitely didn't work for my skin.

I live in Texas wore this for 6 hours when it was applied in store with the primer and it stayed in place! This is an amazing foundation, game changer. I will say WITHOUT the primer the foundation is VERY MATTE! So to avoid that mix in the foundation with the primer in the palm of your hand instead of the back of your hand and apply.

705,glossjuunkiee,Brown,Brunette,Light,Combination,Cuticles,120,"Rihanna honestly came THROUGH with this foundation, because this has to be the closest match to my skin I’ve ever found. I’m a pretty pale person, and by pale, I mean vitamin-D-deficient-because-I-don’t-usually-go-outside pale. So when I shop for foundations (even though on a day-to-day basis I don’t wear much more than eyeliner, mascara, and a little Benefit Gimme Brow), it’s crucial that it matches my skintone so I don’t look like a moron. I’ve never been able to find a single foundation I liked that actually matched my skintone until now! Shade 120 is surprisingly not the palest shade, but it is plenty pale. This foundation does have a tendency to oxidize a shade darker though, so be careful. The formula is pretty great on my skin as well. I have combination skin, and I tend to get oily around my nose and chin, but this formula really didn’t make it that noticeable at all. I did wear pressed powder, though, so I’m not sure how it performs by itself. My only gripe about this formula is that it dries down pretty fast, so you have to blend it in really quickly. It can feel like a race against time, especially when I’m trying to not make my face look patchy without building up too much coverage. But other than that, it’s pretty perfect. I can’t complain.

No foundation has ever matched me before and 100 did BUT it looked so dry and bad on my very oily skin. I don’t know how it made my skin look so bad but I looked so much older. And it had really light coverage for me. Barely coved up my rosacea or acne. Such a disappointment.,0,2,3,20

If your an oily person with any dry patches id probably also stay clear, if you are dry at all run away. Sad for such a good shade range",0,6,9,20

The shade ranges were amazing and I was matched professionally in store. However, this product is NOT MATTE, and creases into every crevice and falls apart around my lips, nose, and laugh lines. It actually looked like beads. I tried without setting powder, with setting powder, with and without setting spray, her makeup brush (which was streaky), and a beauty blender. It dries so fast and that is because I only worked on small sections at a time and worked quickly. Coverage is only medium, but it is a messy type of splotchy build-able coverage that will leave you looking like a mess.",0,2,3,20

I impulsively bought it from just one swatch. when I got home and continued to use it for the next week I became disappointed by how my skin was looking with the foundation on. The foundation really seeped into my pores and made my face look uneven in texture and just didn't flatter my skin at all. Another downside is the wear. It didn't last me very long before my face got super oily again and my foundation was wearing off. I'm definitely going to return this and continue my search for a good foundation.,0,2,3,40

719,Lumpy16,Green,Brunette,Porcelain,Oily,Unknown,100,Oh my god. This is probably my favorite foundation I've ever tried. I can wear it for 8 hours and not have to blot or touch up and that is a big deal for me. I usually get shiny within 3 or 4 hours even with Becca Ever Matte Primer. I just use the Fenty Pro Filt'r Primer and the Farsali Unicorn Essence with this and it looks wonderful for 8+ hours. Seriously my new Holy Grail foundation!!!

Not to mention... it separated with in 6 hours (Im not greasy just get a few oily spots that in my usual just looks dewy after 12 hours) and it seemed to rub off quite easily. I RETURNED.

I think I was only able to keep wearing it because I would use concealer as well and contour to help with the orangeness. It does provide full coverage, but I would sample it first before buying it just so you get the right coverage considering it changes after being on your face for a bit.",0,2,3,60
726,Jessicahairmua,Hazel,Black,Medium,Combination,Aging,290,looove it! It feels light not oily great for all kind of skin. As a makeup artist on specialty on wedding makeup I need a foundation that have high coverage but feels light and last all day and Fentybeauty nailed it!

The application is as described - medium coverage with a matte finish. But the finish is not mannequin matte. It just looks like airbrushed skin. I set with powder and setting spray and it lasts about 7 hours before I see the shine. But it cleans up wonderfully with blotting paper or powder.

I have oily skin so this definitely didn't work for me.

735,starrysparkle,Green,Brunette,Tan,Oily,Acne,320,"I mean how many companies actually launch with a blotting powder? That should tell you something. I have never been more disappointed in a product. Ok so after three trips to Sephora I still do not have a shade that matches my skin tone. I have swatched and been matched and all of the shades in the 300 range are WAY too yellow or orange. There is no true tan shade. I don't care what others say it does oxidize. it does not just ""dry down"", the undertones change as well. So eventhough I couldn't find a perfect match I still wanted to give it a go so I could see if the formula at least worked for me. tl;dr It doesn't work for me. I will say this foundation can look amazing when first applied. I use a Morphe flat top brush from the E line and if the brush has absolutely no product in it (meaning it must be cleaned after EACH use) then this foundation applies beautifully. Now if I forgot to clean it, the application is absolutely horrible! It looks cakey and splotchy. I then use my beautyblender to fix everything, and make it work. It can look beautiful, but because this claims to be long lasting, I expect it to last more than 6 hours without looking shiny (I have worn every foundation under the sun and have never needed to blot before). Not this one. I look like a grease ball after 3 hours and the foundation breaks up and begins to cake on my chin and forehead. Then my pores become much more noticeable than with ANY other foundation I have EVER worn. So the real issue. I AM BREAKING OUT LIKE CRAZY! The only change in my make up routine is the Fenty products. Pros: Shade range for those people with lighter and darker tones. I don't under stand all of the postive reviews unless they are just supporting Rhianna and haven't actually worn this product for long periods of time. This is really the worst foundation I have ever owned between match, not being long wearing, and it making me breakout. This is not for oily people!",0,3,4,20

738,Mom2MJCL,Brown,Brunette,Deep,Oily,Acne,350,"This gets 2 stars for the color match and longevity in wear. Otherwise, I did not like this foundation for my skin which is combination and textured/mature because it shows EVERY imperfection, dry patch, and aged me beyond my years. The color was an almost perfect match for my skin tone which is hard to find in most foundations that I have tried. I applaud her for offering multiple shades and undertones. Aside from that, I found this foundation to have a cakey and dry finish no matter how I applied it. I tried several kinds of brushes, damp beauty blender, my fingers and all produced a dry, cakey finish that didn't budge which would have been good if the finish was flawless. I tried using just one pump to see if that would help, but that was still dry looking just more sheer in coverage. I can't see anyone using more than a pump/pump and a half because of the cakiness. I will be 49 yrs. old in Nov. and take good care for my skin but think this foundation is better suited to younger skin that has no blemishes or texture. This was just too drying and aging for me.",0,6,8,40
739,TayElissa,Blue,Brunette,Fair,Combination,Acne,120,"To put it frankly, this foundation is very matte. VERY matte. Now, I have combination skin...oily with a few dryer areas. This foundation will absolutely cling to any dry areas you have on your face. It dries to a powdery finish very quickly too, so if you do plan on using this product be sure to work on your face in small sections. Don't dot all over your entire face then try in blend it like I did because it stays where it's put. I gave it 3 stars because it does wear nicely and some people like a powdery finish. I think this would be a good product for someone who is straight oily skinned. For me, it seemed to age my skin. It looked dryer than I like, but after several hours it looked dewy and a little more natural so I liked it the longer I wore it. That being said, I don't think this foundation is worth the amount of prep in order to make it look acceptable, and I don't want to have to wait for it to get there. I have drugstore foundations that look the way I want them to immediately and require much less skin preparation beforehand. Secondly, this may not be superb for super oily skin either because like I said, I have combo skin but still looked dewy after about 5 hours. I PRAISE Rihanna for her makeup line, because this will be a holy grail for some I am sure. It just isn't for everybody, but no product is!",0,6,8,60

That has never happened before lol. He hates makeup but I love wearing makeup everyday so he sees my makeup all the time. I told him I was trying out the new fenty foundation and the next day I saw him he was like “wow is that the fenty foundation? It actually looks really good.” And that was by 9 pm after 9 hours of wear at work and no touch ups or blotting!!! I highly recommend to at least get a sample. I got shade 150 and I’m about an NC25. I didn’t notice any oxidation, or maybe it oxidized to my perfect shade match. Im more of a yellow/neutral undertone and this shade was great. Usually foundations look way too pink on me.",1,1,1,100

I tried it with four different primers (one being the Fenty that goes with it) and at least three different setting powders and sprays. No matter what I used, it would always end up separating on my skin after only a few hours of wear. It creased in every crack it could get to (some I didn't even know I had until after using this product). Definitely will not repurchase. The only good thing I know to say is the shade range.

This foundation would be a 5 star product if it offered more coverage. I feel like she purposely designed the foundation to go only with her brush for sales. Beauty blender is horrible with this too!

It seems to be really dry, too, maybe because this is trying to be ""matte."" A couple of thoughts: If you need the perfect tint for pale skin, this may be it, but you might need to 1. shake it REALLY well first. I shook it, but maybe not enough? 2. be prepared to experiment with primers, brushes, and sponges to get it to look smooth and not patchy, and probably work really quickly with it.

It really does have excellent coverage, and I don't care too much for a full face everyday, so I use barely one full pump for my entire face. A little goes a long way!

The coverage claims to be medium but it's very light on me and I have to really cake it on to cover my redness (which is very moderate and can be covered by all my other foundations).

It’s a matte foundation but it does not feel drying at all and it’s light to medium coverage just like it claims to be. The only problem i have with the foundation is that it oxidizes so I wish I’d went with a shade lighter. However that can be easily avoided by selecting a lighter shade with the same undertone so I wouldn’t see it as a big disadvantage. Another issue I noticed which not many people have talked about is that this foundation is not for you if you have dry and flakey skin because it will cling on to those spots and make your skin look drier and worse. Thank god it’s summer now and since it’s more humid, my skin gets a bit oily so the foundation works well. However in the winter when I have really dry skin, it does not look good. So if you have normal to oily skin, this foundation would look great on you but if you’re more on the dry side I’d recommend getting a sample and trying it out first.

I should have known because the hype about this product before it even came out was intense. It is now breaking the Internet with the thousands of positive reviews it’s getting. Pop Sugar states “Since the collection launched Sept. 8, YouTube and Instagram have flooded with reviews, especially of the matte, full-coverage Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Foundation.” This product is amazing because it’s the only line that’s likely to have every shade. The 40 shades go from fair skinned to the darkest shade of brown. Buzzfeed blogged all the foundation colors to show how well they match all skin tones. Rihanna made sure to make this cruelty-free foundation affordable and accessible to practically all women. With 32ml for only 34$ this foundation is an amazing alternative for daily wear. Compared to some of the most popular foundations, like my usual, La Mer that tops at 110$ for only 30ml (1oz). She had worked on it for almost two years prior to releasing it to the public. The consistency and the coverage are incredible. It comes in a fogged, glass, bottle with a sleek and simple design. The pump makes the bottle differ from most foundations because; it prevents you from shaking out too much of the product. Unlike a lot of the foundations on the market Fenty changed the game with the pump bottle. When using foundations such as Tarte or La Mer you have to squeeze or pour out the product to apply it to your face. When squeezing the tube I always squeeze out way too much and end up washing a days worth of foundation down the drain. Fenty has changed that with the pump, it puts out the perfect amount every time. It also keeps your foundation fresh and sanitary. The product itself comes out a bit runny, but goes on your skin incredibly smooth.",1,1,1,100

The formula is drying and I need to wear it with a lot of moisturizer. I also think it needs ALOT of blending to look good... like 10 minutes just blending. Otherwise I think it emphasizes texture and clings to every imperfection on my face. Once it's blended well I do think it looks nice, has a nice matte but not dry finish. I would call it solid medium coverage. I wouldn't recommend this for a beginner or someone who wants a quick easy routine I feel it needs a lot of work to look good.

They all looked crazy. Fenty forgot about olive skinned people. No, don't tell me cool, yellow, or warm because that doesn't work! When we tan, we are in a league of our own. When I returned the product, the Sephora team tried to give me some bs about waiting and setting times. I've been screaming for two years that no foundation matches my skin. Key phrase, MATCH SKIN! I don't want to look like a coloring book. With neutral ""tan"" skin that can go from J Lo/Jessica Alba to Kelly Rowland in a matter of an hour or two, I wish makeup brands ~ and Sephora will learn this. Stop making me orange. My tan skin is not orange. It's brownish. Think camouflage! There are a large group of people in the world; south European, North Africa and Western Asia with skin exactly like mine. In the Americas, ""Dominicans"" and deeply mixed ""African Americans"", no not Creole or ""yellow bones."" The ones like me who can pass for almost any group of you merely change their hair texture with a wig. Most people assume oh you're brown, you are ""black"" and always look that way. NO! I tan across ethnicities. lol -Fenty Beauty is the ONLY brand that came close. I think I may be able to wear the 300 in January/February if I don't go out much or travel to anywhere like LA. In closing, I think the formula of the foundation was great. I would have gave 4 stars if their was a shade for me. 1 star deducted for shades and another star for the scent and acne it caused. I included pics of how I tan.",0,8,7,60

This is possibly the worst foundation I have ever used. If you are on the paler side with acne, hyper-pigmentation or textured skin tone, this foundation WILL NOT WORK. I have minor acne with scarring. This foundation offers little to no coverage and clings onto any spot of texture or dryness. I would rather have 20 shades instead 40 if they are not all of the same quality. I did end up keeping this foundation to use as mixer but otherwise it would have been returned.

I have done everything to get this foundation to look good. I don't have dry skin and yet this foundation attaches itself to things on the face I never knew I had. I've tried primer, no primer. Moisturizer, no moisturizer. I've tried different ways to apply it, beauty blender, brushes, fingers. I've tried using different amounts. On top of that, this foundation drys QUICK. There is no time to blend. Literally as I blend its already dried down. The shade is perfect but its not worth looking aged 10 years. For as much as it costs there is no reason why anyone should have to go to such lengths to make it look presentable. There are drugstore foundations that completely blow this foundation out of the water. Save you money.",0,5,4,20

861,devyydoll,Blue,Blonde,Porcelain,Dry,Acne,100,"I have very, very pale skin. This is the first foundation I have ever bought that is remotely pale enough for me (after it oxidizes it's still a bit too dark). However, it will cling to EVERYTHING, even stuff you didn't know you had. It'll cling to all of your peach fuzz and any relatively dry bits. It also accentuates any sort of little bumps or texture you may have. This foundation also sets at an insane rate. I always have to double check my face for foundation lines because it'll set before I can fully blend it out. I really wish Fenty would come out with a dewy formula with the same shade selection in the future. Just the formula on this one is way too unforgiving for anyone with ay sort of skin issue at all.",0,3,2,60

I have combination skin so at the end of a long shift yes I’m a little oily, but I’m ok with that. Looks natural. The consistency of it is nice too it’s more liquidy than other(most) foundations, so it feels lightweight but is very pigmented. 4 stars because it was difficult to find my shade and also because they oxidize which adds to that problem.

I used a damp Beauty blender to apply it. I felt that it set very quickly, which was fine, but it was not easy to blend out completely. I felt like it would gather in patches on my cheeks and it failed to give me an all over matte finish. I used this product with the Fenty primer as well, in hopes that would improve the look and wear of the foundation. Applying with a brush may have yielded different results, but I'm not so sure.

I work indoors, moderate humidity, comfortable temperature, and my foundation isn't there at the end of my shift. I moisturize and use a primer before application and finish with setting powder.

Not problematic, but dry. This was far more matte than Milk (something I love but have to prime with oil or hydrating primer and can only apply with a sponge). And by matte, I mean this was patchy and streaky and gross. It collected in areas around my nose, and is far from transfer proof...which is the least I would expect from a matte.

The color matching was outstanding, one of the best I'd ever had, BUT I did NOT LOVE how quickly it soaked into my skin and dried. Putting it on in sections did not help. Putting it on over an oil serum and heavy moisturizer did not keep it from soaking right into my pores and fine lines. This foundation literally aged me by 10-15 years and I had to wipe it off. I am in my late 30s, but my skin is still normal and not that heavily wrinkled. This was such a disappointment. I have not yet tried the blotting powder, but I hope it performs better.",0,2,1,20

I paired it with the primer and followed the video very closely. It just didn't work for me.

The brush applied the foundation better than the blender by far but in both cases, it was patchy, required a TON of product and took forever to blend out. Most importantly, the results were okay at best. It's probably also worth mentioning that I moisturized, let that set, and then primed with a moisturizing primer before applying this on one side, and applied a more basic primer on the other. Both sides were a bit of a mess. My ONLY skin issues are dryness and a little bit of redness--no acne, not acne prone, and even then the coverage was meh.

I went to Sephora to potentially exchange a different foundation I bought online, without getting shade matched first. I have VERY fair skin and I explained everything I was looking for in a foundation. Instead of testing a different shade of the foundation I had already purchased, the sales associate brought me to the Fenty Beauty section. She did a shade match and the lightest shade (100) seemed absolutely perfect! She explained that it is a medium to full coverage matte foundation that doesn't look dull while wearing it (all of the qualities I said I was looking for). I was nervous she was trying to persuade me to purchase this bc it is a new item. I inquired about other brands that offer very fair shade options as well, but her response was that those will be too ""yellow"" and not as perfectly neutral as the Fenty Beauty foundation. While picking this foundation and a different concealer, I asked if it contained fragrance. She said she didn't think so and glanced at the box. Normally I am on top of things like that and always look for myself. I don't buy products without researching them first and inspecting the ingredients. I guess I was not feeling well and was also in a rush. So far, I have only used it on my neck (another SA already applied a different foundation on my jaw line, and it looked orange on me) and my hand. I have an important day tomorrow, so I wanted to be prepared with a nice foundation. By the time I got home and went to try this foundation, I read the ingredients, and there IS fragrance. I am absolutely appalled. I returned the other foundation I had, (I did like the way it applied, but it was a tad too orange on me- although I'm sure I could've added my fair compact powder on top to neutralize the orange tint) and now I'm stuck with a foundation that I can't use bc it has fragrance.

I explained to the salesperson that I have dry skin. When I got home I prepped my face with a very good moisturizer, and primer. I then used my foundation brush to apply. I looked like I had taken talcum powder and applied it to my face! I thought maybe I had applied too much primer. ( the primer was new as well ) I immediately washed everything off, and put moisturizer on my face. After about three hours, I applied the foundation again, this time without the primer. I looked even worse, if that's even possible. I looked ghostly white, and my skin was flaky all over. For this application, I applied moisturizer like I always do when applying foundation. I have never had this happen before with a foundation. It was beyond hideous. So, this foundation is going back asap! If you're going to try this product, I would ask the salesperson to apply it to your entire face before leaving the store, and if you have dry skin, I'd be very wary of this product. I gave two stars because the salesperson did try to color match it to my skin, but it was the first day of the launch, so she probably had not much experience with this product.

The texture was insane and everything seemed so enlarged. I then tried using my pore filling primer the next time then same thing. So dissapionted.

The only reason it hasn't got a 5-star from me is that I'm now noticing its causing acne on my skin which I couldnt figure out before. So if you do have sensititve skin make sure you do a patch test, wouldn't recommend for sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, etc.",1,1,0,80

I tried to give it one last chance and applied it this morning at 8am and when I got to work at 9:45 I already had to wipe sections off and fill in with another foundation because it looked awful.

I been using for a month and a half and have come to the conclusion that this is not for me. The foundation INSTANTLY dries once it touches your skin which makes blending almost IMPOSSIBLE. It feels gross through out the day and is NOT BUILDABLE as it leaves you looking caked and fake. If you have dry skin than this definitely is your enemy. It makes you look flakey and highlights your imperfections rather than conceal. I rather attend events bare faced than show up with this on. Please do better.,0,1,0,20

I have extremely pale skin, and finding a foundation that I love and also matches my skin color is almost impossible. I had heard lots of good things surrounding Fenty Beauty's large shade range for months, so, finally, I purchased the foundation. It matches my skin very well; I don't have to lighten it with a white foundation (I have to with other foundations I use) but the formula did not impress me. Dislikes: I knew it dried down quickly from the YouTube reviews I watched before purchasing, but I had no idea just how quick. I dotted the foundation onto one portion of my face, and used a damp beauty sponge (Miracle Complexion Sponge from RealTechniques) to blend the product in. On certain areas of my face, you could see a faint circle of where I dotted the foundation, even after blending well. The biggest thing I didn't like was how it clung to the dry skin on my face. I have combination skin: oily T-zone, dry areas around my mouth and cheeks. I don't have actual dry spots at this time of year, but the skin in that area is definitely drier than my T-zone. I loved the way the foundation looked on my forehead (oily skin), but my cheeks and mouth (dry skin) left much to be desired. Even though I didn't have any spots of dryness at the time, the foundation seemed to emphasize what wasn't there before. Likes: The consistency is not thick, but not very liquid-like either, it's a good in-between. If you have oily skin, I think you'll love this product. It tones down the oiliness, but still lets your skin have a nice, natural look to it. It makes your skin soft, a sort of velvet-matte feel. The foundation smells powdery to me, but it isn't overpowering or unpleasant. It stays on the skin for a long time, and does not smudge away easily. My oily T-zone still looked nice after 8 hours of wear. I won't purchase this product again. But if it works for you, then rock it like Rihanna!",0,0,0,60

1145,yasminflower99,Brown,Brunette,Light,Combination,Blackheads,200,"This foundation is amazing, because of the colour range but also the formula. I have never really found any difficulty finding the right foundation shade, so when the only complements I heard about this foundation were about the shade range, I was happy for those who could finally find the right shade but I didn't really want to buy it. I was only when I put it on in store that I realized how amazing it is. It smooths out my imperfections better than any other foundation I've tried without looking heavy and my skin feels so soft to the touch. My only suggestion is to moisturize before you put it on, I have heard of a lot of people complaining that it is not good for dry skin but that isn't true, my cheeks are so dry and as long as you moisturize before, it will look perfect. I never really give things 5 stars but this foundation was just too good!",1,0,0,100
1146,carismaj,Brown,Brunette,Light,Dry,Blackheads,190,I think the problem people are having with this foundation is that they are applying too much. This isn't a foundation you pump on your hand and go in ham and blend and finesse. When I first tried this I strongly disliked this. I went in how I would with a dewy foundation and that was a big mistake. I have very very dry skin. If I moisturize and prime this goes on fine. I usually take the bottle and pump very small amounts and buff out with a Morphe Y6. Very little goes a very long way. This foundation doesn't need to be set and it lasts all day. It looks just like your skin. It's kind of crazy and I think it's how foundation should look. Anything you put over doesn't cling and blends fine. Only con is it dries a little fast. But working in section only makes sure that I blend like a bawsssssss.,1,0,0,100

I use a stippling brush to apply and then blend out with a beauty blender. I lightly set with a translucent powder and a setting spray. It makes my skin look flawless, even when I have break outs. I love the way it smells, not perfumey just a subtle scent, but it doesnt linger. There is very very little to no transfer for me. It does not come off until I wash it off!

First of all, I would recommend you get color matched in store as they have a variety of colors and undertones. Second, shake foundation bottle very well for long lasting effect. I've worn it for the past two weeks and have received many compliments on how natural my makeup looks. This foundation is superior to others I've tried for combination oily skin like mine because it dries up matte and powdery which for one allows me to totally skip on translucent powder and keeps oiliness at bay for at least 8 hours. I've even worn it on sweltering humid weather in which I tend to blot my face more than usual to dry my sweaty face and the foundation stays intact. I wear two layers for medium to full coverage which is enough to cover my blemishes and even out my skin tone but still look like I'm not wearing makeup.

1158,mojo918,Blue,Blonde,Porcelain,Combination,Acne,120,"HG FOUNDATION. I wear this with a primer under it, but nothing fancy--usually I just use that cheap the Ordinary silicone primer. My skin is oily af and I'm very acne prone. I wear this with Nars Soft Matte Concealer in 01, drugstore setting powder (the Nyx unpigmented one), and some UD Setting Spray--either all-nighter or de-slick. I also live ~6 mos of the year on average in India, sweating my butt off. This stuff doesn't budge! I'm p lazy and often find myself in situations where I can't just touch up my makeup whenever lesser foundations might need it; with this stuff (at least in combination with these other products), I don't need to! Has longer lasting, higher coverage, matte-r appearance than anything else on the market. Pricey enough to keep me from pulling the trigger until I ran out of my old foundation, and I agree with other reviewers that it dries down crazy fast, which is not great for someone like me who is both inexperienced and easily frustrated, but the payoff is WORTH IT. Plus, I like supporting a brand that seems to have such great options for underserved WOC. I will say as well that I can't wear a pigmented setting powder with this or it looks crazy yellow on my neutral-to-cool undertones.",1,0,0,100
1159,hauteschik,Brown,Black,Olive,Oily,Acne,300,"I don't believe I have ever rated a foundation 5 stars. So my normally hard to please and highly critical self is shocked and appalled. At this point in my life (the life of a makeup addict), I have probably tried over dozens and dozens (~50) of foundations. Nothing has every hit every mark or check everything off of my long list of demands. The oils of my skin are stronger than superman and break apart my foundation and my face becomes an oily grease slick within a matter of 30 minutes to 1 hour (even with primers, setting sprays and powder). If somehow my skin managed to stay matte, the foundation oxidizes or is a far cry from a close match. My top foundations prior to this were Èstee Lauder Double Wear (mix between 3W2 and 4W1) and MAC Studio Fix Fluid (NC40 and NC42). While this foundation is not perfect, it is the closest thing to a magical unicorn I've ever come across. Without a primer or setting spray or setting powder, this foundation managed to matte for 8 HOURS! Including my nose, which never stays matte. The color match is slightly darker (Shade 300), but the undertone is fantastic. My skin is golden Olive undertone. Most foundations are too orange or too pink or too yellow. Rihanna managed to get my undertone right ... I would bow to her if I could. The coverage is medium to full. But to get full coverage, you have to build up at least two to three layers. The price is a bit high at first but when you consider the quality and packaging (comes with a pump <3!). Honestly, my favorite part of this foundation is the fact that Rihanna thought of all women in mind. So ridiculously happy to see women of all skin colors and women of color especially get a wide variety choices, it literally brought me to tears. So hats off to everyone involved in creating this foundation.",1,0,0,100

I absolutely love this foundation for the fact that the color matches my skin so well. However, there are some days that it will randomly get very patchy on my forehead, around my nose, and my cheeks and others where my skin looks flawless. It may be the fact that my skin may be a little dry on those days, although I always moisturize and prime before putting this foundation on. The foundation and primer both smell amazing, and it keeps my oily complextion to a minimum. After a long day of wearing it (8 or so more hours) I do notice my shine come through and my makeup starts to feel heavy, but I'm sure thats nothing a touch up can't help. Overall, I love this foundation and will most likely repurchase. If you're thinking about trying this foundation, you NEED to get color matched before purchasing.

Also doesn't rub off on the bridge of my nose onto my glasses as much as other premium brand foundations I've used. Really impressed. Rihanna got it right this time.

This is a great foundation for oily people. I have a little bit of oily skin but it's not insanely bad so this foundation is workable for me. The only thing about it is that I find my concealer doesn't love being on top of it andwhen I first apply it and it can tend to look cakey and dry on top of it. I use the maybelline age rewind concealer. When I set it it looks better and after my skin has time to produce oils my skin looks bomb af. To me it's one of those foundations that is strictly for oily people and if you don't have oils on your skin then it's not going to look like your skin it is going to look dry and possibly patchy. But I have also heard people with dry skin love his foundation too so I guess it all depends on personal preference.,1,0,0,80

Like it’s not even a match for if I were my summer color. Also another thing I have started to have issues with is it’s separating on my skin so bad in areas that aren’t dry nor oily. I don’t believe that was an issue I would’ve ignored. I don’t know why but today has hit the final straw I have with this foundation, really hoping I can return or exchange and get a foundation I can actually wear and not be so self conscious of the color and obvious separation.

It seriously covers everything! I started taking birth control to help get my skin under control and even at its worst this foundation covered everything and made it less embarrassing to go out in public with my volcano face. It is also the perfect match for my weird, pale olive Italian skin. It is truly seamless which I have never ever found. I can't say enough good things about it honestly. I am oily and it keeps me matte throughout the day, and living in Florida, that is a huge deal. I've also worn this to the gym with no issue which was shocking to me. The only complaint I have it that it looks extremely weird if it gets wet (swimming or splashing water on your face). It gets a greyish cast and just looks awful. All in all, this foundation is excellent and it's priced great. I got this in November or October and haven't even gotten halfway through it yet and I use it every day (one pump).

This foundation has a beautiful finish..more matte than i usually gravitate towards but the finish is a lasting one. (Used Kat Von D loose powder) This foundation is easy to apply with a brush or a beauty sponge (same finish). Sets quickly (maybe a bit too quick - you have to work in sections) and provides medium coverage (blemishes are less obvious - not covered completely) The foundation wears really well for the first 5 hours, whether or not you set it with a (loose) powder. After that, a few parts do break up, leaving either: cakiness or some seperation. The foundation does feel VERY light for the amount of product you use (i use 1 pump for medium-bordering on full coverage) so it's very economical. The shade selection is glorious. The undertones listed are true-to-tone. The packaging is beautiful and feels luxe. Now. The cons. I have used foundations that provide as much coverage but wear better. I have used foundations that are easier to colour match and have no dry-down. I have ALSO used foundations that feel more elegant. This is a great foundation that maybe only truly dry skins will dislike. I can't wait to try it with the Fenty blotting powder and applied using different technique. Highly recommend.",1,0,0,80

It turned out to be a perfect match! I love that there are so many undertones to choose from. Many foundations are too yellow on me. I have dry skin with a slightly oily t-zone. I bought the primer. I had never used one before but thought I’d give it a try. I am amazed that I don’t need to powder my nose at lunch. No shine at all. I personally love the matte finish. I hate shiny foundation. This dries quickly and leaves a perfectly smooth finish. I would say it is a medium coverage, not thick or heavy. I made the mistake of using too much at first and it looked streaky. I use one pump and then a tiny bit more if I have redness or something that needs a bit more coverage. I bought the foundation brush but think I might needs to find another brush. It doesn’t cover evenly around the nose and chin. I am very happy with this foundation!",1,0,0,100

You can’t use this foundation with any type of pore blurring primer, it ends up just moving around and eventually setting into your pores. By the end of the day the foundation basically soaked into my pores and you could see every pore and fine line. It broke my skin out pretty bad. I have done the same routine for over a year and haven’t broken out, after 3 weeks of using this, my fave broke out, I noticed more blackheads, and my pores appeared larger. I’m taking hormones into play too, but I only use this foundation now if I plan on wearing it for a few hours. Coverage is good, but It’s buildable so I need more than 2 pumps. It doesn’t dry fast and I do believe it goes on lighter and then becomes darker after trying. I don’t think it’s meant for someone with larger pores and oily skin.

1361,Oliviavanessa,Brown,Brunette,Medium,Combination,Aging,180,I wasn’t sure if I wanted to try this at first because I find that usually a lot of products have too much hype and then end up not being worth it. However this one is worth the hype. My skin tone to me can be confusing because sometimes I fit good into a medium shade and sometimes better into a light shade due to my yellow undertones with some redness on my cheeks. (I’m Mexican American by the way.) I’ve even purchase the makeup forever chromatic mixes in brown and yellow to change my foundations to what I need because there is hardly a perfect shade for me. When I matched myself online I thought I would be a 190 but when I went in store and they used the color matching machine on me it said I would be a 240! It was a huge difference. So luckily I had a friend with me who aided the girl in trying them on to find my best shade. I ended up with the 180. It was perfect and flawless. I don’t think my skin ever looked like my skin but better. I was so sad to leave the store after finding my shade because no one in San Antonio had it in stock. I waited impatiently for it to be in stock at Sephora and I’m glad i waited. Thank you Rihanna for making the perfect foundation for me! ***one thing I learned from this foundation is to always shake it before using it.

Cleanse, toner/lotion, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen and primer. That’s the way I do it and it works well with this foundation. Sometimes I do another layer of toner/lotion just to be on the safe side. If I don’t moisturize enough, the foundation does cling to the dry patches. I use a buffing brush, dot my face with the foundation and work in sections. I’ve used a Beauty Blender with this foundation and it took more work and an extra pump, so I decided just to stick with the brush. You gotta work fast though. It’s a runny formula but don’t be fooled because it does dry fast! The finish is matte and it generally keeps the oil away. I do have to use blotting sheets once every few hours but this foundation does stay on my face for the whole day. Tested it for 12 hours and I had some shine but it was good enough for me. One major con for me is that because the formula is so runny, you do have residue on the pump so you gotta wipe it often or use that to dab over your eyes for an eye shadow base.

I started out using the Urban Decay Naked Skin foundation for about a year, and then as I got more oily and needed a heavier coverage, longer lasting, and not as runny as a formula, I searched for something different. I tried the Urban Decay All Nighter, then the Kat Von D Lock It Foundation, and none worked as well as this. I found the All Nighter to be a little too thick and oxidizing, the Kat Von D to be way too thick and made me break out (it also had a paint smell), and then I sampled and tried this, and it clicked. The formula is perfect-- it is not too thick or thin, and only still takes one pump for my entire face. It settles beautifully, gives me time to blend, and it dries matte but not too matte to where it's drying. The color also hardly oxidizes, and it is much cheaper than the other options that didn't even work as well. It pairs perfectly with the smashbox photo finish primer, and other products sit nicely on top of it.

It isn't the easiest formula to use, and I had difficulties with color matching. Overall, it's a decent foundation. If it wasn't for the blurring affect and the pore minimization I would rate 2 stars. It's just extremely cakey and not an easy application. For the price, I would recommend something else.",0,0,0,60

Not only that, but this really is a nice foundation and leaves my oily, pore ridden skin looking so smooth. Unlike many foundations, I found this product has the best coverage and application when applied with a brush. Especially with the brand's foundation brush, which may be a con because the brush costs just as much as the foundation. I found that it was very sheer when applied with a beauty blender and needed 2 layers with a brush to have medium coverage.

1680,lalochezia,Brown,Brunette,Light,Oily,Blackheads,180,"I was skeptical to believe the hype about how good this foundation is but I'm soooo glad that I tested it out for myself. I've been on the hunt forever for a foundation that does everything I want it to. I have finally found it! With the medium coverage it's a nice in-between of my super matte (Estee Lauder) and super sheer (Tarteguard Tinted moisturizer) products that I use. It really is a ""my skin but better"" foundation. I have super oily skin and I wore this to two outdoor events and I didn't need to touch up. I was oily but it looked more 'dewy' and the foundation didn't break up at all, so that was really nice. I also really appreciate the shade range. It's always been hard to match my skin tone and undertone. Foundations always end up too light or too dark or the undertone is off and I end up having to cocktail products, which I just don't feel like doing all of the time. This foundation fits me perfectly once it's dry. (I actually used my shoulder and neck to swatch lol). Personally, I didn't have extreme oxidation, just a slight change in color. This foundation does dry pretty fast, so you gotta work kinda quick to get it on. I've used both a beauty blender and a foundation brush. With the blender, it was slightly lighter coverage than it was with the brush. The packaging is luxurious. There is a slight scent to the foundation and it smells really good, kind of like a cologne. I love it. This is going to be my main foundation for the foreseeable future.",1,0,0,100

I was thrilled when I got my package and saw the box that the foundation came in; the plastic lid is a bit of a let down but at this price point, it's not an issue in the rating. This foundation is one of, if not the best, I've used. I picked my shade online and it's perfect. Slightly lighter than I'm used to but truly a perfect match. I typically use Becca First Light primer and it works lovely with Fenty's formula. GlamGlow's Volcasmic matte glow moisturizer and Glowstarter also work great. I'm guessing one would be hard pressed to find something that doesn't work well with it. I had to get used to using a liquid foundation rather than a concentrated cream/liquid which isn't a big deal. I've used it without primer and had amazing results so I believe the key is skin care. If you have a good skin care regimen and adhere to the less is more philosophy, I truly think this will work for the majority of customers. Remember to shake it well, and it applies beautifully with fingers alone. I've also found the VIB Rouge Mini Flawless airbrush works fabulously and is less messy. I've had no breakouts, no oiliness, no accenting of dry patches or settling into fine lines, and minimal transfer. It also plays nice with the many brands and formulas of blush, contour, and highlighter that I own which is great! I set it with Laura Mercier translucent powder and it's good to go! A medium coverage, natural finish, quick and easy application, coupled with every shade imaginable makes this a foundation that I'd recommend to anybody'! Also, this wears longer and much better than Urban Decay's All Nighter for me; it's been on point for 16 hours! As it's currently winter, I can't attest to how well it'll work in 90 degree heat with 100% humidity but I suspect there won't be any problems that setting spray can't fix!",1,0,0,100

When I put it on it looked extremely patchy and made my skin feel incredibly dry. I had to put a lot more of the foundation on (than I usually do with other brands of foundations) to make my skin look actually even and decent enough to go out in public with. Also this foundation is problematic because it very easily wipes off, if you go to lightly itch your face or just lean your head on your hand it wipes off and looks uneven.

1810,Eye Color Brown,Brown,Brunette,Light,Combination,Acne,160,"I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION! When I wear it it is a very nice matte. Not overly matte or too dewy. It makes my skin look like a better version of itself. I was kind of hesitant to try it, but I got a color match in Sephora and 160 blended really perfectly into my skin tone. Usually I have more yellow undertones when it comes to foundation, and in this description it says it has a peachy undertone but I don't think it's too peachy, only the slightest in my opinion. With one application total my face was medium coverage, and I builded it up for full coverage. I did not experience any creasing at all but I typically avoid putting a lot of foundation in my smile lines anyway. It is very lightweight and does not feel cakey at ALL! Since this foundation does dry fairly quickly, what I do is I pump a bit on my finger to place it on my skin and then use a beauty blender to blend it out. From what I've experienced with foundations in general this really helps when you have to move quickly. I used this in my normal face routine as well because I really wanted to see how it would hold up, primer, color corrector, foundation, powder, and it looked beautiful. The bottle itself feels very nice and heavy like more expensive foundations feel like, looks very chic, and I honestly have no complaints that I could give, I highly recommend that you at least get a sample of this or try it out in store- well worth it!!! :)",1,0,0,100

Just make sure you shake it before you use it (LOL) and be sure to apply a moisturizer as this can dry your skin if you are prone to having dry skin.

One of the biggest things I love about this foundation is that it is super light weight. It is almost if you never even wore foundation. The coverage is about medium coverage but that is totally fine with me since I usually don't go for full coverage anyway. The foundation also lasts a long time. I actually wore this foundation when I went to took my law school final. I had a huge mental breakdown in the middle of it and cried my eyes out. The foundation stayed put! If a foundation can still be there for you after you cried, that's a good foundation. My only complaint about the foundation is about the bottle. While the bottle is BEAUTIFUL, it's incredibly fragile. I placed the foundation on my sink and lightly tapped it with my elbow.. long story short, I broke the foundation bottle and wasted $32 two days after I bought this foundation. I know a lot of foundation bottles have this kind of glass bottle so it is not necessarily Fenty Beauty's fault. I am just very clumsy.

Light-Medium coverage. - Stayed matte. - Good price for the performance. Cons: - I got shade 120 (for fair skin with neutral undertones) and I have to say it was SUPER yellow-toned. Did not look neutral-toned at all. I have tried countless foundations and am always ""neutral toned"", perhaps this line runs yellow-ish and I need to try one of their warm toned shades. - The staying power was not what I hoped, even after using a primer, setting powder, and setting spray. The corners of my nose lost coverage within a few hours. I can see why others like it, but I don't think its for me.

1917,Billeh,Brown,Black,Tan,Combination,Acne,210,"I have had my doubts about matte foundations since I usually have to use 3 different foundations on my face in range between matte and dewy due to different consistencies of my skin type(combination). But this foundation has indefinitely made a difference in comparison to most. The soft matte has a very clean and fresh look while maintaining its quality throughout the day. Especially when I work 8-10 hour shifts, it has stayed on and not melted nor caked. Although the only issues I have with this is that the coverage is quite sheer for medium coverage, which is good for building up product, but the consistency is so thin that it tends to separate quite a bit. Another issue would be how fast and how much it oxidizes. Thankfully I have tan skin and oxidizing doesn't really become an issue, but the oxidizing in this foundation is so noticeable.

I got shade matched at the store and was a bit scared it would be too light, and when first applying it it really makes me look like a ghost but by the time I'm done the rest of my face it has oxydised and matches me perfectly.

It does a pretty good job at keeping my oily skin at bay, when equipped with a mattifying primer and well-moisturized skin. However, by end of day, the foundation is practically gone except for the center of my face, specifically bunching up by the side of my nostrils.

Although it's layerable I think it's best worn lightly. The main reason I would not buy this product again is the finish. It seeps into every pore and is not a flattering look at all.

This foundation is a perfect match for my skin tone and I've gotten lots of complements on how nice my skin looks! When I tell people it's Fenty foundation they are shocked and don't believe that I am wearing anything at all! I had no idea what the powers of a GOOD foundation could do. Totally covers my redness and evens out my skin tone without feeling heavy or sticky. I will say that it is quite drying for my skin, so I apply moisturizer and a light layer of coconut oil to my face before using the foundation. I have so much fun wearing this foundation! I'd recommend getting color matched in the store too, because it's free and I was matched at a darker shade than I would've thought if I had ordered online. BLESS YOU, RIRI!",1,0,0,100

However, I have drier skin and some dry patches too, so this foundation may not look good if you don't prep your skin properly. One trick to make sure the foundation looks flawless and beautiful is to exfoliate your skin, moisturize and using primer beforehand. Once you do that, it'll look amazing.

Once it's dry it leaves an amazing light and soft finish and leaves my face feeling so nice all day.

Rihanna has gotten the foundation colours right for someone with olive undertones and the packaging is beautiful. Initially the foundation comes out quite watery, but when applied to the face (either using a Beauty Blender or a brush) it dries to a matte finish. Therefore, move quickly to blend. Foundation provides a light to medium coverage and does not feel heavy on the face. For all makeup lovers with oily or combination skin, this is a dream come true. Wearing it with the Fenty Primer or other primers that I own, I don't have to blot any oil for about 5 - 6 hours and if using a setting spray about 7 - 8 hours. Using the Fenty Invisimatte Blotting Powder as a light setting powder and a setting spray, I can go 8 - 9 hours depending on the weather.

Today I put it to the test and wore it for 8 hours and it didn't move. I highly recommend this foundation.",1,0,0,100

I have the worst combination skin. Im super dry some spots and incredibly oily others. I also have giant pores.

My first thought upon applying was “wow this is lightweight”. My oils still peeked through after several hours but that’s typical for me and my oily face. I don’t expect miracles. But it didn’t break down and the oils were controlled for the most part. I blotted and went to the gym about 2.5 hours after application (normally I won’t wear any makeup there but I was curious) and through the sweating and blotting with a wet sweat cloth ... minimal transfer and still no breakdown. Unheard off. I was literally pressing a wet cloth to my face. And barely any makeup came off. After the sweat and oil it never felt heavy. I actually forgot I was wearing it. This is the most comfortable formula I have ever worn. I did minimal blush and contour to see if it stayed and I was still seeing it at 1 am. I am impressed.

2370,ryyy,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,150,"I picked up a sample of this because, you know, it's fenty beauty... to start I was impressed at the number of shades. I ended up trying shade 150. The undertone was a nice neutral upon application, but it pulled really yellow/olive by the end of the day... it also oxidized at least a shade -- if not two -- darker than what it swatched. For reference, I have combo skin -- oily tzone with dry patches -- so it should have been a good fit for my skin... but I was disappointed immediately when this settled into my pores -- and it made me look older -- but I wanted to love it so I applied Powder to help diffuse the look of it. Fast forward about 2 hours later: it had oxidized but it still matched me pretty well, and the foundation seemed to have melded into my skin. It actually looked pretty nice. It did not transfer at this point, and it did not look as bad as it did right after applying it. Moving on to about 5 hours after application: it's transferring off of my cheek onto my phone (I'm not oily on my cheeks) and the color has started to turn very yellow. It looks decent on the skin though. End of the day -- about 8 hours after application -- my face is a hot mess... it broke up everywhere, especially in my tzone, and the color was awful by this point -- I actually looked like I was green in the gills. Based on my experience, the foundation is not for me. Maybe I'm too oily in the tzone, and maybe I have to buy the fenty primer to make it work -- but I feel like if I have to buy a product just to make another product work then it's just not worth it. It had potential around the 2 hour mark, but it did not have the longevity I need from a foundation. I'm glad it works for so many other people, and that it is a good price! Plus there are so many shades -- which is why I gave this 3 stars.",0,0,0,60

This one goes on beautifully. I mean with a beauty blender, this looks flawless. I used Sephora #56 and then went over with a BB to give it an airbrushed look. I used a moisturizer and then i applied this right on top and set with Urban Decay All Nighter Spray. It goes on soft matte just like described. It immediately feels like its meant to be for oily skin. Around the 5 hour mark, I started to see separation on my chin and i was shinny in my T zone. Nothing crazy but I did powder at that point. It didnt look good :( powder over this is no bueno. However I will say with primer and those blotting sheets Fenty sells as well you will be amazed. Lasts all day but if going out at night you will need to reapply. It didnt cling to a dry pimple i have on my chin at all but the area around my mouth did separate. (that normal for me) Overall, for the price point this is a great foundation. The shade range can be tricky because there are so many but I this is a great foundation and a great primer as well.

2405,Supremejessie,Blue,Red,Light,Normal,Blackheads,110,"Ok real talk. I bought this foundation a month after it was released. It was my first high end foundation ever purchased, and I figured why not. Heard mostly great reviews about the products which in the end prompted me to buy it. One thing I wish beauty gurus would review or talk more about is how other products work with each other. I wore the foundation with my ABH contour sticks and it was terrible. I would put on my primer, then my foundation using a beauty blender, and then my concealer and contour. I found when I add the concealer over top certain places on my face (ie. Chin and the side of my nose) the product would almost come right off. I also found it took a lot of blending in order to get it to blend in with the foundation. Now this stuff I learned to work around it and figure out a way to fix it. The two things I absolutely couldn’t stand was after 8 hrs of wearing this it looked like the foundation was seeping into my pores. You could see where all the concealer on my face was (especially the forehead) and it just was not a good look. I also had the issue with the fact that I wear glasses, and for some reason this makeup would literally wear off in the span of 30mins if it my frame were to touch my cheek. Obviously I was aware that this would happen, foundation usually comes off around the nose pieces, but never has a foundation rubbed off from where my glasses were on my cheek. Overall this product was ok. I think if you were to use her contour and concealer stinks with the foundation it’d work a lot better. But if you ain’t got the money to spend on all the products in order to look nice, then I wouldn’t suggest it.",0,0,0,40

There was another flaw to this foundation that I couldn’t ignore, which was how it easily dried on my face. I understand that it’s a matte foundation so this problem would occur but it’s just so hard me to blend especially when I’m in a rush. If you get this, you have to pick up a little each time and blend. You can’t put it all on your face at once because it’ll dry out. It’s very time consuming if you’re always in a rush.

It's extremely light weight, inexpensive, and very full coverage even though it's not advertised as full coverage. I've always had very sensitive skin with cystic acne so buying foundation has always been a problem. This is the only foundation that not only doesn't cause any break outs but doesn't make your skin feel oily or so heavy like many others do. I've practically tried every single foundation out trying to find one that works for me and that is good for my skin and I'm so happy that I finally have found it.

I have pretty oily skin which makes wearing regular foundations hard for me, because at the end of the day it leaves me with lines, creases, and a shiny forehead and nose. I'm not one to always have blotting paper or powder on hand to touch my makeup up, so I decided to try this matte foundation in hopes of it being of some help. This foundation did wonders for my skin! I love it so much that I have bought three of them so far, and see myself buying more in the future. It has a velvety smooth finish that dries and leaves your skin looking photoshop flawless. It's almost like you have a filter on your face! It's also buildable, and has amazing coverage and staying power. I wore it to prom and danced and sweated in it, and still looked amazing at the end of the night! Not an oily patch or crease in sight! Absolutely LOVE this foundation. It also has a very nice light smell on top of everything. I'm very pleased with this product.

I would give it 0 stars but the shade range is amazing, that’s my only compliment towards this foundation. Forget that Rihanna made this line, and judge the foundation just as any other foundation. It’s just not good. As soon as I put the foundation on it oxidized to a BANANA YELLOW color. Even my co workers had to tell me that I looked really bad...any way, First I tried it with a beauty blender which usually makes all my foundations look beautiful on the skin, but it did the exact opposite. It just sat on top of my skin and separated every where !! I have normal to dry skin so I have no idea why it separated so I thought maybe it’s the beauty blender. So I try again in a few days WITH A BRUSH, and the same thing happened. It was patchy all over my nose and forehead and that has never happened to me before. I wash, exfoliated and prepped my skin before each application so I was really confused. I ended up giving my foundation away to a friend and I’ve never done that before.

I am not prone to breakouts, I have combination skin, and I use Rodan Fields UNBLEMISH every day for minor zits and controlling blemishes. This product has, for lack of a better way of describing it, ruined my face. I have a total of probably ten or more massive zits that will not shrink and will not go away. I have even tried treating them with antibiotic creams -- it doesn't help. FENTY is well aware that their products cause extremely oily skin, as they released blotting papers and powder at the same time as the rest of the line. Maybe I'm mistaken, but that seemed fishy to me from the beginning; like a promise of oily skin. This foundation also did not look good with anything but FENTY's primer under it, which is a shame, because that's just another layer of silicones for your skin to fight to try to breathe through. All in all, I'm so disappointed and so sad that this product did me so dirty. I wish I could've left a better review.
