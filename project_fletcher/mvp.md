# Domain
I will be working with makeup data. I'm taking reviews on Feny Beauty Pro Filt'r Matte Foundation on Sephora. I am pathologically obsessed with skincare/makeup so I know this domain well.

# Data
There are currently 10,443 reviews on the website, all of which have some amount of text content.

The columns look like this:

| User | Rating | Helpful | Review | Skin Color | Skin Concern |

You can find the scraped file in the main page of this repository.

# Known Unknowns
The biggest concern with this project is making it into a proper (complicated) NLP project.

I can do sentiment analysis on the reviews to predict the output and also look at how helpful each review has been tagged as. I'd want to segment the complaints by skin color and type then see which concerns pop up more frequently (Categorizing feedback) and can maybe throw in some recommendations (eg if this concern pops up, try this product/hack).

Other than this, I'm not sure what I'd do that's really NLP. It has a clear business use case, and I'm really interested in the topic so I would like to move forward with it.
