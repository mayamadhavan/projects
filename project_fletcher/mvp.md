# Domain
I want to do a project whereing I try to identify fake news articles via their titles. I went to a liberal arts college and was in school during the rise of the right, so I've seen plenty of these types of articles floating around on social media. Since this has been in the news so much recently, I'm very familiar with the topic. Also my childhood/pipe dream was to be a journalist, so I'm pretty familiar with this domain.

# Data
I've found a couple of aggragated datasets relating to this topic.
1. [Both Real and Fake News] (https://github.com/GeorgeMcIntire/fake_real_news_dataset)
2. [Mostly Alt-Right, All Fake] (https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news)
3. [List of Datasets!] (https://github.com/sumeetkr/AwesomeFakeNews)

I want to avoid partisanship, so I'd personally go with #1. It has titles and id of real/fake

If there's a problem with all of these datasets, I could also do a scrape of titles from liberal/conservative/alt websites and hand classify the test set.


# Known Unknowns
Firstly, whether or not something is fake news is inherently arbitrary. given that someone is always going to argue that something is real/not and many news articles can be read as opinion pieces (see: Laura Ingraham's recent comments). So there's one problem. 

Of the optional concepts, I expect this topic to cover Topic Modeling and Classification,

I think the topic (fake news) is interesting, but what I want to do with it is a litle boring (just ID what is fake and what isn't), which isn't really a known unknown but hey.

I could also do a sentiment analysis on the response there is to articles on fake news sites as compared to or liberal/conservative reporting and id the type of people who would be sharing given articles based on their locatiom

I have backup ideas as well in case this doesn't work.
