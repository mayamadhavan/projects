Football is a particularly big attraction in the fall, as fans support the Auburn Tigers with the help of school mascot Aubie the Tiger. The Tiger sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and the influx of football fans makes Auburn the fifth-largest city in the state on game days. Pep rallies are held in the downtown Toomer's Corner, and the area is covered in toilet paper by fans after every big victory. There are more than 300 organizations on campus, and about 6,000 students are involved in the school's Greek system. Auburn freshmen ease into the college transition through Camp War Eagle, a two-day, overnight summer orientation program. Transition help continues on Hey Day, an annual effort to get students to wear name tags and say hello to one another. Freshmen do not have to live on campus; in fact, a dorm room isn't even guaranteed. Because of space restraints, first-year students are awarded on-campus living assignments on a first-come, first-served basis. ",D1

Student athletic supporters form the ZonaZoo, the student section that supports the Arizona Wildcats sports teams, which compete in the NCAA Division I Pac-12 Conference. For athletes who don't compete on the school's teams, there are three levels of intramural sports: the Desert league, which emphasizes fun; the Sunset league, geared to moderate athletes; and the Cactus league, meant for very skilled and competitive athletes. For other ways to get involved, University of Arizona students can check out more than 30 fraternities and sororities, among many other student organizations. Freshmen are not required to live on campus, though first-year students make up about 80 percent of the on-campus residential population. Each year, the university community gathers for events like the Spring Fling, billed as the largest student-run carnival in the country, and Homecoming. As a research institution, the University of Arizona also offers a variety of opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students to get involved in research projects. The university has a wide range of graduate student programs, including the Eller College of Management, the James E. Rogers College of Law and a College of Medicine. Notable alumni of the University of Arizona include reality television star Kourtney Kardashian and journalist Geraldo Rivera. ",D1

Students looking to hone their leadership skills have many options, too: They can enroll in the LeaderShape Institute, a six-day getaway workshop; attend the Leadership Development Series, which meets three times a semester; or participate in one of the many programs offered through the Center for Student Involvement & Leadership. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but more than 90 percent choose to do so. Campus life may pose a challenge to tobacco users, as Iowa is a smoke-free campus. Students have more than 500 clubs and organizations from which to choose, and close to 10 percent of students go Greek as members of the school's nearly 50 fraternities and sororities. Sports are another big focus of campus life; even in the competitive NCAA Division I Big Ten Conference, the Iowa Hawkeyes are notorious players. Four blocks from campus is Iowa City, a Midwestern metropolis that has been recognized among the nation's best for its scenery, greenery and sustainable energy efforts. ",D1

The Campus Ministry organizes specialized retreats and mission trips throughout the year, and the on-campus church holds a daily Mass. The Saint Louis Prayerbook is an online database of prayers - some traditional, others original and submitted by students or faculty members. In addition to religious extracurriculars, students can also choose from more than 150 student organizations at SLU, including more than 20 fraternities and sororities. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent's home, are married or have been in the military for at least two years, among other exemptions. In total, about 90 percent of freshmen live on campus - all in halls exclusively for first-year students. Students can get involved in campus leadership positions as early as the second semester of freshman year. The St. Louis Billikens compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic 10 Conference. The Billiken is an unusual mascot - a smiling, gnome-like figure that is a considered to be a good-luck charm. Off campus, students can explore downtown St. Louis, Missouri, home to the Grand Center arts district, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery and several professional sports teams. On the nearby Mississippi Riverfront, students can bike, sail and check out the Museum of Westward Expansion. ",D1

Today, Fordham has two more campuses: Lincoln Center, which is close to Central Park, and Westchester campus, which is in West Harrison, N.Y. Freshmen do not have to live on campus, but any student who is promised housing upon admittance to the school is guaranteed a room for four consecutive years. Students can travel between campuses on the school's Ram Van, a burgundy shuttle that runs every half hour. The van makes enough trips, the school has calculated, that it's covered a distance equivalent to traveling around the world 18.5 times a year.

A brilliant shade of orange is tied into campus life, manifesting itself in student media outlets such as The Daily Orange, the student-run newspaper, and CitrusTV, the television studio. The school's sports teams are known simply as The Orange, and compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic Coast Conference, cheered on by school mascot Otto the Orange. The football team plays in Carrier Dome, famed as the only domed stadium in the Northeast. The school's campus sits on University Hill, above the sprawling city of Syracuse in central New York state. With about 100 inches of snowfall each year, the bitterly cold winters at Syracuse University give students plenty of opportunities for skiing, snowboarding and sledding on nearby mountains. On campus, there are more than 300 student clubs and organizations. About 20 percent of Syracuse students are involved in Greek life, though only juniors and seniors may live in Greek housing. All freshmen and sophomore students must live in on-campus housing. The free Connective Corridor bus shuttles transport students between campus and downtown Syracuse, where annual celebrations include a 12-day Winterfest and a Jazz Fest. ",D1

The orange Clemson Tigers compete in the NCAA Division I Atlantic Coast Conference. The teams are supported by notoriously passionate student fans and two costumed student mascots, known as The Tiger and The Tiger Cub. There are more than 400 student clubs and organizations, and about 25 percent of students are involved in the school's large Greek system. Clemson is set on Hartwell Lake, where students can sail, swim and fish. For indoor fun, the on-campus Underground Recreation Center has a bowling alley, arcade and billiards room. Students can travel for free on campus bus system The CAT, which connects students between Clemson University and the nearby city of Clemson, S.C. The city of Clemson is within walking distance of campus, too, and offers a typical active college scene with many shopping, dining and nightlife options. Freshmen must live in university housing, and nearly half of all students choose to live on the school's picturesque, tree-lined campus. ",D1

There are more than 40 fraternities and sororities, and the organizations compete in their own intramural sports leagues.

The school mascot, not surprisingly, is a bear. Baylor University also has its own holiday, Diadeloso, a day when classes are canceled so students can participate in athletics tournaments and attend free concerts.

Students don't have to go far for an adventure, though; UVM has an adventure ropes course and an indoor rock climbing wall. There are more than 170 student organizations on campus, including about 15 fraternities and sororities. Fewer than 10 percent of students go Greek. Freshmen and sophomores must live on campus. The Catamounts athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I America East Conference, cheered on by a mountain cat mascot named Rally. In Burlington, students can explore the outdoor Church Street Marketplace, a collection of restaurants and boutiques, or relax on the shores of Lake Champlain. For a more urban experience, Montreal and Boston are about 100 and 220 miles away, respectively. ",D1

Stanford offers a wide range of student organizations, including the Stanford Pre-Business Association and Stanford Solar Car Project, which designs, builds and races a solar car every two years. The Stanford Cardinals are well known for the traditional ""Big Game"" against Cal, an annual football competition that awards the Stanford Axe--a sought-after trophy--to the victor. Stanford also has successful programs in tennis and golf. Only freshman are required to live on campus, but students are guaranteed housing for all four years and most choose to remain on campus. Greek life at Stanford represents approximately 10 percent of the student body. ",D1
