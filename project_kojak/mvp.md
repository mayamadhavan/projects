# Project Proposals

## Thought Process- Ignore
So I've had quite a few project ideas, but I've been throwing them away for various reasons
1. Predicting Scholarshps- There is the education.gov college scorecard, which is absolutely massive and has multile years. I could do a related project using this. See below.
2. Predicting Spread of Cholera- Not enough data, and this is a water born disease, not a seasonal one.
3. Predicting Impact of Well Placement in Certain Areas- Not enough data about impacts of current wells (train sets
4. Image Recognition of Bikes for use with cameras behind cars- Not enough video data, though there is plenty image data and I remember that image analysis wasn't recommended.
6. Improving Youtube advertising using video titles and description boxes- Not sure how sucessful this would be; I would need to pick and choose the videos I would use, and then I'd worry about how I could generalize given the inauthicity of the data.
## Final Idea- Recommending Best Fit College

### Data
I will be working with College Scorecard Data. This is a collection of datasets from 1996 to 2015. For the time being, I don't plan to make this into a time series problem, so I will only be focusing on the most recent school year that's available in the download, which is information about the 2015-2016 school year.

The 2015 file has 7594 schools with 2060+ columns relating to their acceptance rates, sat scores, graduation rate, etc..

I am also planning to combine this data with US News ranking for 2016 where applicable.

### Domain
Since I just graduated from college and went through the 2013-2014 application process, I'm fairly familiar with this domain. I am not well versed in community college operations though.

### Game Plan
I plan to make a recommender for prospective students. These students will input desirable college traits, testing scores, desired income (still deciding what to put here), whether they need a loan and how long they would be willing to spend paying it off, and I'll return a list of the highest ranked schools that:
1. Fit their requirements, and
2. They can get into

### Known Unknowns
The dataset is fairly messy, and I anticipate a heavy data cleaning aspect. There is a data dictionary which maps some of the the current column names, which are largely unreadable, to a user friendly name. Unfortunately, it's not comprehensive, so there are still some columns whose meanings I can't interpret. I still have enough data even without these columns, but this is a consideration to keep in mind.




With the College Scorecard Data I could make a recommender of the best school to go to based on your scores, income, future income goals, and interests. I could also look at how schools have changed over time combined with their US News Ranking for that given year (for schools that have been ranked), etc... There's
